## Accursed

A drow enters a tavern, hitting his head on the door frame and tripping on a chair leg. As he rises back to his feet, a brawl begins amongst a couple other patrons. With a look, a sigh, and flick of his wrist, the brawlers both slip on an errant puddle of grog, hit their heads on tabletops, and fall unconscious. Finally arriving at the bar, the drow can enjoy his drinks.

An elf argues with herself as she engages an orc raiding party in combat. Recalcitrantly, a spirit exits the elf's body, a thin cord of Ethereal energy connecting the two, and fights alongside her, unleashing a terrible scream that causes the bandits all to drop dead of fright.

Wielding a terrible blade, a human engages the palace guards, slicing her adversaries in twain as if they were cloth. An archer comes around the corner, and she throws her sword, impaling the guard before he can even nock an arrow. As the vile weapon reappears in her outstretched hand, she saunters into the throne room, staring at the quivering king with death in her eyes. At last, the crown is hers.

Accurseds are afflicted with a permanent magic that is inconvenient at best and debilitating at worst. But magic is still magic, and accurseds have found a way to harness the power of their curse to their own ends, while managing some of the worst symptoms of their condition. Either way, their curse is now theirs to use however they see fit.

### Unending Affliction

Most curses used by mortals — such as the hex and bestow curse spells — are temporary, a simple inconvenience until the magic expires. For each accursed, though, the affliction is permanent, a powerful magic that never fades. These curses can be received through many means: gaining the ire of a deity, a large coven of hags, or a powerful extraplanar entity; inheriting it by being born into a cursed family line; touching a cursed object; being hit by a volatile spell that was incorrectly cast; or receiving the curse from the bite or scratch of another cursed creature, among a slew of other possibilities.

### Curse's Conqueror

The vast majority of people who receive a permanent curse consign themselves to their fate, either finding a way to live with their curse's adverse effects or giving themselves fully to the curse's compulsions. A creature becomes an accursed by following a different path. Accurseds are rare, not due to lack of people becoming cursed, but because those who suffer these curses often lack the conviction to resist them.

An accursed dedicates their time and willpower to find a way to make the magic of their curse work for them, though each in their own way. Some accurseds experiment in a lab or scour the world for forgotten lore, trying to find a ritual or alchemical concoction. Others turn to nature or faith, using prayer, meditation, or mindfulness to synthesize the curse's magic into their own being. And others still use sheer stubbornness to bend the curse to their will.

Regardless of method, an accursed is one who has conquered their curse, drawing on its magic while managing its lingering side effects.

Regardless of method, an accursed is one who has conquered their curse, drawing on its magic while managing its lingering side effects.

### Creating an Accursed

When creating an accursed, the most important aspect to consider is your curse itself. What is your curse's nature, and how did you receive it? As a starting character, you'll choose the nature of your curse, but exactly how you received it is up to you. Did you or one of your ancestors anger a god or other powerful entity? Was the curse transferred to you by another afflicted individual? Or did some magic ritual go awry with you in proximity?

Another important aspect of creating an accursed is how you came to be in control of your curse's power. Did you study and experiment? Did you harmonize with it? Or did you stubbornly refuse to let it control you?

What do you plan to do with this power you've attained? A curse is a magic of vile energies created to inflict suffering. Do you use this magic for its intended purpose, conquering and slaying for your own gain? Or do you resist the magic's nature and use it to become a champion of the downtrodden, a hero who can empathize with great suffering? It's your power now, so only you can decide what to do with it.

#### Quick Build

You can make an accursed quickly by following these suggestions. Your highest score depends greatly on the Conquered Curse you choose: make Strength your highest ability score for a Conquered Curse that relies on melee or thrown weapons, Dexterity your highest ability score for one that relies on finesse or ranged weapons, or your choice of curse ability — Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma — for one that relies on the use of the curse's magical effects.

If Strength or Dexterity is your highest ability score, your next-highest should be your choice of curse ability, followed by Constitution; for the more magically oriented Conquered Curses, make your next-highest ability score Constitution, followed by Dexterity. Then, choose the folk hero background.

## Class Features

### Conquered Curse (Level 1)

Through unfortunate circumstances, you were stricken with a curse that should have broken you. However, whether by sheer willpower, introspective meditation, or arcane study, you not only overcame the worst of the challenges your curse presented, but learned to harness its power. Choose the curse you conquered: 

- [[Curse of Animation]]
- [[Curse of the Armament]]
- [[Curse of Combustion]]
- [[Curse of the Created]]
- [[Curse of Immortality]]
- [[Curse of Misfortune]]
- [[Curse of Mummification]]
- [[Curse of Petrification]]
- [[Curse of Somnolence]]
 
All conquered curses are detailed at the end of the class.

Your curse has become an integral part of you. The remove curse spell, as well as any similar effect, has no effect on your curse when it is cast on you. If your curse takes the form of a magical disease, you can't be cured of it by any means.

Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 5th, 11th, 15th, and 20th level, as well as a list of curse spells (detailed in the Spellcasting class feature).

#### Ailments

Each curse has ailments caused by its lingering effects. They are inconvenient, and occasionally dangerous, detriments to which you are always subject, and are referred to by features you gain later in this class.

#### Curse Ability & Curse Save DC

Some of your accursed features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. Due to the varying ways that an accursed can overcome their affliction, not all utilize the same ability score to control it. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your curse ability.

You should choose Intelligence if you scoured the multiverse for secrets that allow you to manage your curse using rituals or minor magical practices, Wisdom if you used introspective meditation techniques to harmonize with your curse and make it a part of you, or Charisma if you conquered your curse through sheer force of will or by bargaining with it.

Depending on the curse ability you chose, the saving throw DC of your accursed features is calculated as follows:

<span class='abilityDc'>**Curse save DC**: Spellcasting + Proficiency Bonus</span>

### Jinx (Level 1)

As an action, you can attempt to bestow a minor curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become subject to your choice of one of the following jinxes until the end of your next turn:

- The target has disadvantage on the next ability check it makes.  
- The target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against a creature of your choice that you can see.  

If a creature can see you when you use this feature, it knows that you are the source of the jinx. Until the target makes the type of roll associated with the jinx, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain the effect, extending the jinx's duration until the end of your next turn. However, the jinx ends once the target makes the associated type of roll, if you are more than 90 feet from the target, or if any of the dispel magic, greater restoration, or remove curse spells is cast on the target.

### Malediction Metamorphosis (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, your curse begins evolving within you, changed by your manipulation of its purpose. You can guide this mutation to compliment your capabilities, or open new avenues of power for yourself.

You gain one [malediction metamorphosis](/3-Content/Compendiums/lists/list-optfeaturetype-mal.md) of your choice. Your metamorphosis options are listed at the end of the class's description. When you reach certain accursed levels, you gain additional metamorphoses of your choice, as shown in the Malediction Metamorphoses column of the Accursed table.

### Spellcasting (Level 2)

At 2nd level, you learn to use your curse's vile magicks to fuel the casting of spells. See "Chapter 10" in the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting.

#### Spell Slots

The Accursed table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Curse Spells

Each Conquered Curse has a list of spells — its curse spells — that you learn when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the curse description. These spells are added to the accursed spell list for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Accursed table. You ignore the material component requirement of a curse spell if it has one.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know the curse spell you gain at 2nd level from your Conquered Curse, and one 1st-level spell of your choice from the accursed spell list, for a total of two spells known.

The Spells Known column of the Accursed table shows when you learn more spells of your choice from the accursed spell list. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, when you reach 5th level in this class, you learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level, in addition to the curse spell you gain at 5th level from your Conquered Curse.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the accursed spells you know — which can be one of your curse spells — and replace it with another spell from the accursed spell list, which must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Your curse ability is your spellcasting ability for your accursed spells, since your ability to cast spells comes from the control you have over your curse's power. You use your curse ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your curse ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an accursed spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<span class='abilityDc'>**Spell save DC**: Spellcasting + Proficiency Bonus</span>

<span class='abilityAttackMod'>**Spell attack modifier**: Spellcasting + Proficiency Bonus</span>

#### Spellcasting Focus

When you gain this feature, choose arcane foci, druidic foci, or holy symbols, depending on how you discovered to channel your curse. You can use the chosen type of implement or a cursed object as a spellcasting focus (found in "chapter 5" of the Player's Handbook) for your accursed spells.

### Ailment Control (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can also use your spell slots to exert control over your curse's ailments, either afflicting another creature with one of your ailments or suppressing your ailments' effects on yourself. The duration of the effect depends on the level of the spell slot expended to use it: 1 minute for a 1st-level spell slot, 10 minutes for a 2nd-level, 1 hour for a 3rd-level, 8 hours for a 4th-level, or 24 hours for a spell slot of 5th-level or higher.

#### Afflict

As an action, you can expend a spell slot to attempt to afflict a creature within 30 feet that you can see with your choice of one of your curse's ailments. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer the chosen ailment for the duration. At the end of each of an afflicted creature's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending its affliction on a successful save. A dispel magic, greater restoration, or remove curse spell cast on the target also ends its affliction.

#### Suppress

As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot and choose any number of your curse's ailments. You ignore the effects of the chosen ailments for the duration.

### Conquered Curse feature (Level 3)

At 3th level, you gain a feature granted by your Conquered Curse.

### Jealous Blight (Level 3)

At 3rd level, your curse begins possessively guarding you from others of its ilk, refusing to share its host. When you touch or attune to a cursed object other than your curse, it doesn't stop being cursed, but the object's curse doesn't affect you.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 4)

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Malediction Versatility (Level 4)

Starting at 4th level, whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one of your metamorphoses with a different metamorphosis for which you qualify.

If you're 12th level or higher and replacing a metamorphosis causes you to no longer meet another metamorphosis' prerequisites, you must replace that metamorphosis as well. For example, if you choose to replace your [Arcane Anathema](/3-Content/Compendiums/optional-features/arcane-anathema-ultimateadventurer.md) metamorphosis with [Enshrouding Imprecation](/3-Content/Compendiums/optional-features/enshrouding-imprecation-ultimateadventurer.md), you must also replace the [Capacious Anathema](/3-Content/Compendiums/optional-features/capacious-anathema-ultimateadventurer.md) metamorphosis if you have it because you would no longer meet its prerequisites. Since you chose Enshrouding Imprecation, you can replace Capacious Anathema with any other metamorphosis that doesn't have a prerequisite, or with the [Muffling Imprecation](/3-Content/Compendiums/optional-features/muffling-imprecation-ultimateadventurer.md) or [Sleighting Imprecation](/3-Content/Compendiums/optional-features/sleighting-imprecation-ultimateadventurer.md) metamorphosis because you now meet its prerequisites.

You can't use this feature to choose a metamorphosis with an 18th level prerequisite, unless the metamorphosis you are replacing has that prerequisite.

### Conquered Curse feature (Level 5)

At 5th level, you gain a feature granted by your Conquered Curse.

### Jealous Blight Improvement (Level 7)

Once you reach 7th level in this class, your curse protects you from a wider range of effects. You are immune to curse effects other than your curse, such as the hex and bestow curse spells, and your hit point maximum and ability scores can't be reduced against your will.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 8)

When you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Conquered Curse feature (Level 11)

At 11th level, you gain a feature granted by your Conquered Curse.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 12)

When you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Jealous Blight Improvement (Level 14)

Once you reach 14th level in this class, a magical effect other than your curse can't age you, possess you, put you to sleep, or transform you against your will.

### Conquered Curse feature (Level 15)

At 15th level, you gain a feature granted by your Conquered Curse.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 16)

When you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 19)

When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Conquered Curse feature (Level 20)

At 20th level, you gain a feature granted by your Conquered Curse.

### Jealous Blight Improvement (Level 20)

Once you reach 20th level in this class, a magical effect other than your curse can't impose disadvantage on any roll you make.

## Class Features

### Curse of Petrification (Level 1)

You spent unknown years, maybe even decades or centuries, as a statue â€” a literal stone shell of your former self. You may have angered a vengeful god or powerful spellcaster, fell victim to a gorgon's breath, or caught the gaze of a medusa. No matter how you were petrified, you eventually regained conscious awareness, though not the ability to move or awareness of your surroundings. This lack of stimulus and utter isolation drove you to near madness, if it didn't entirely tear your sanity apart, before you realized that though the nature of your curse is converting biological matter to stone, it should be possible to reverse the polarity of its magic. Somehow accessing this ability, you managed to return yourself to flesh and escape your stony prison. Armed with the knowledge that you can convert yourself between stone and flesh at will, you are excited to get rolling back into the world, though a part of you does miss the comforting permanence of stone...

### Petrification Ailments (Level 1)

As a creature accursed with having your body converted into inanimate rock, you suffer the following ailments:

- Your body is still unnaturally dense, tripling your weight. Due to this density, your movements have a large amount of inertia. When you use any of your movement on your turn in combat, you must use your full movement before you can end your turn.  
- You sink like stone. Any swimming speed you have becomes 0 and can't increase, and you automatically fail any ability check you make to swim. If the liquid is deeper than your height, you sink to the bottom at a rate of 60 feet per round, and can move at your normal walking speed along the bottom of the body of liquid once you reach it.  

### Stone Form (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, you can magically transform your flesh into living rock, protecting yourself against harm while still allowing you to act normally. As an action, you can enter this stone form, or transform back from your stone form into your normal form. While in your stone form, you reduce any nonmagical damage you take by 1. The reduction increases by 1 when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (2), 10th level (3), 15th level (4), and 20th level (5).

Additionally while in your stone form, you can use a slam, which is a natural melee weapon with which you are proficient and that deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d10 + your Strength modifier on a hit. Once you reach 6th level in this class, your slam counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Living Statue (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, while you remain motionless in your stone form, you are indistinguishable from an inanimate statue. To remain motionless enough to maintain this effect, you must hold your breath, following the rules for Suffocating in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook.

### Curse Spells (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, your increasing mastery of your curse causes you to learn a particular spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Petrification Curse Spells table. See the Spellcasting class feature for how curse spells work.

**Petrification Curse Spells**

| Accursed Level | Spells |
|----------------|--------|
| 2nd | earth tremor |
| 5th | earthbind |
| 9th | meld into stone |
| 13th | stoneskin |
| 17th | transmute rock |

### Mountain's Endurance (Level 3)

At 3rd level, all the time you've spent holding your breath grants you greater lung capacity. You can hold your breath for twice as long before you start suffocating.

### Rolling Boulder (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your momentum to empower your slams. Once during each of your turns when you move at least 15 feet straight toward a creature, object, or structure and then hit it with your slam, the attack deals an extra `d10` damage to the target. If the target is no more than one size larger than you, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

If the target is two or more sizes larger than you, any speed you have becomes 0 for the rest of the turn, and you gain a +1 bonus to the slam's damage for every 5 feet of movement you lost.

The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach certain levels in this class: 11th level (`2d10`), and 17th level (`3d10`).

### Extra Attack (Level 5)

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Stone to Flesh (Level 5)

Starting at 5th level, when you become petrified by an effect other than your curse, you can use the tricks you learned in conquering your curse to return to your original flesh form after 10 minutes, provided that the effect causing the condition would normally have a longer duration.

The time you must spend before you can return to your flesh form decreases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1 minute at 11th level, and to until the end of your next turn at 20th level.

### Quartz Form (Level 11)

At 11th level, you gain the following benefits while in stone form:

- When you use your [Rolling Boulder](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-petrification-ultimateadventurer.md#Rolling%20Boulder%20(Level%203)) on an object or structure, the attack deals double the damage to the target.  
- You can apply the damage reduction from your stone form to any damage you take except for psychic damage, even if that damage is magical.  
- While in your stone form, you can add your curse ability modifier (minimum 1) to any ability check or saving throw you make to resist being pushed, shoved, or knocked prone.  

### Rolling Avalanche (Level 15)

Starting at 15th level, you can move through the space of any creature that is prone without using any additional movement. If you successfully knock a creature prone with your [Rolling Boulder](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-petrification-ultimateadventurer.md#Rolling%20Boulder%20(Level%203)), you can use the feature a second time this turn, provided that the attack has a different target.

### Diamond Form (Level 20)

At 20th level, the rock that makes up your stone form becomes harder than diamond, and just as eternal. While in your stone form, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage, you don't age, and you can hold your breath indefinitely without suffocating.

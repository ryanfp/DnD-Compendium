## Class Features

### Curse of the Created (Level 1)

You were not born, nor were you cursed. Instead, you lurched to life with electricity crackling in the air around you. Your creator intended you to be a perfect specimen of their own kind, but when the stitched together corpses you're made of gained sentience, you were only a grotesque facsimile of true life. Your presence is deeply unsettling to others, including your creator, who may have abandoned you shortly after your animation. Despite their persistent rejections, you long to find a place among other humanoids, though you sometimes wonder if you aren't more like the monster they see you as...

### Created Ailments (Level 1)

As a creature accursed with a disturbing approximation of true life, you suffer the following ailments:

- When you take fire damage, you have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws until the end of your next turn.  
- You have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with humanoids, except those meant to frighten or intimidate.  

### It's Alive! (Level 1)

At 1st level, once when you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to be reduced to 1 hit point instead. When you do, you gain 5 x your accursed level in temporary hit points and each creature within 5 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes lightning damage equal to 5 x your accursed level. On a success, it takes half as much.

You regain the use of this feature the next time your current hit points are equal to your maximum hit points.

### Armed and Angry (Level 1)

Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and shields.

### Curse Spells (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, your increasing mastery of your curse causes you to learn a particular spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Created Curse Spells table. See the Spellcasting class feature for how curse spells work.

**Created Curse Spells**

| Accursed Level | Spells |
|----------------|--------|
| 2nd | cause fear |
| 5th | [ward against weapons](/3-Content/Compendiums/spells/ward-against-weapons-ultimateadventurer.md) |
| 9th | lightning bolt |

| 17th | raise dead |

### Last Life's Memories (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, you recall fragmented memories from one of the creatures whose body you are made up of. Choose a skill or two tools. You gain proficiency in that skill or with those tools.

### Shocking Strike (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can deal an additional `d6` lightning damage to the target. When you do, until the end of your next turn, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against creatures other than you.

### Extra Attack (Level 5)

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Electric Charge (Level 11)

At 11th level, you gain resistance to lightning damage. Immediately after you take lightning damage, you gain that many temporary hit points. You lose any remaining temporary hit points from this feature after 1 minute.

In addition, when you deal damage with a melee weapon attack while you have temporary hit points, you can choose to expend a number of your temporary hit points up to half your accursed level. When you do, the melee weapon attack deals additional lightning damage equal to the temporary hit points expended.

### Reassemble Corpus (Level 15)

Starting at 15th level, the maximum value of your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores increases from 20 to 22.

In addition, each time you finish a long rest<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup>, you can choose to decrease your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability score by 2 to increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability score by 2, to a maximum of 22.

### Stolen Spark (Level 20)

At 20th level, you can use a bonus action to grasp at the spark of eternal life. When you do, you gain the following benefits for the next minute:

- The additional lightning damage from your Shocking Strike feature increases to `d12`.  
- At the start of each of your turns, you regain 5 hit points and gain 10 temporary hit points.  
- You gain a +1 bonus to all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that add your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution modifier.  

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup> before you can use it again. You regain the use of this feature early if you use the reaction granted by your [It's Alive!](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-the-created-ultimateadventurer.md#It's%20Alive!%20(Level%201)) feature.

## Class Features

### Curse of the Armament (Level 1)

One of the most common curses suffered by adventurers and explorers is attuning to a cursed object. Many suffer the inconvenience only so long as it takes to get a remove curse spell cast on themselves, but for some reason you chose to remain attuned to a cursed weapon. Perhaps you didn't have the connections or money to have the spell cast, or maybe there was something compelling about the weapon's history that made you reluctant to part with it. Regardless of your reasons, you've embraced your connection with the weapon, despite its annoying tendency to never leave you alone, and have dedicated yourself to mastering it. You may have become a bit obsessed with the combination of magic and martial might the weapon contains, and want to explore just how far it can take you...

### Armament Ailments (Level 1)

As a creature accursed by attuning to a cursed weapon, you suffer the following ailments:

- You have disadvantage on attack rolls you make using weapons other than your curse armament.  
- You are permanently attuned to your curse armament and can't become unattuned from it by any means, even if another creature attempts to attune to it. Such a creature's attempts to attune to your curse armament automatically fail.  

### Acolyte of Arms (Level 1)

At 1st level, you dedicate yourself to the mastery of melee weapons in an attempt to better understand the armament that just won't leave you alone. You have proficiency with martial melee weapons.

Choose a melee weapon without the heavy property from your starting equipment. This weapon becomes your curse armament. It is a cursed magical object, but doesn't count as magical for the purpose of spells you cast, such as the magic weapon spell.

If your curse armament is ever destroyed, its curse instantly transfers to the nearest nonmagical melee weapon in your possession, or that isn't being worn or carried if you don't have any other melee weapons. The new weapon becomes your curse armament.

### Clinging Curse (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, if your curse armament is ever further than 20 feet from you, it instantly reappears in your space, whether in your hand, in its scabbard or other container, or on the ground (your choice each time it reappears in your space due to an accursed class feature).

You've learned to use this unique property to your advantage. Your curse armament has the thrown (range 20/60) property. When you throw it as part of an attack, it reappears in your space immediately following the attack. If you throw it 20 or more feet this way, it doesn't reappear in your space until after the attack is completed.

### Curse Spells (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, your increasing mastery of your curse causes you to learn a particular spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Armament Curse Spells table. See the Spellcasting class feature for how curse spells work.

### Bond of Bloodthirst (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, due to your greater bond with your curse armament, you can draw further power from it when you strike. Once during each of your turns when you hit with a curse armament attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `d6` damage.

Additionally, you can coax the magicks of your curse into another melee weapon over the course of a short or long rest. Before you begin the rest, you choose a nonmagical melee weapon in your possession, which can be a weapon with the heavy property. You must remain in contact with your curse armament and the chosen weapon for the duration of the rest. At the end of the rest, the chosen weapon becomes your new curse armament and your previous curse armament loses all of the properties granted to it by your curse.

### Voracious Weapon (Level 3)

At 3rd level, envious of the advances you've made by tapping into its magic, your curse armament begins to hunger for its own growth in power. When you attune to a magic melee weapon, you can choose to feed it to your curse armament, causing the consumed weapon to be absorbed within your curse armament, which gains its magical properties. For example, if you feed a flame tongue to your curse armament, it gains the flame tongue's ability to ignite by speaking a command word, shedding light and dealing additional fire damage while it is ignited as detailed in the item's description. While your curse armament has a magic item consumed this way, it counts as magical for the purpose of spells you cast.

When you feed a magic weapon to your curse armament this way, you still count as being attuned to the consumed weapon. Your curse armament regurgitates the consumed weapon, losing the weapon's properties, if you feed it a different magic melee weapon, if you become unattuned from the consumed weapon, or if you use your action to cause it to regurgitate the weapon.

### Extra Attack (Level 5)

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Fighting Style (Level 11)

At 11th level, your expertise with your curse armament allows you to adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Reciprocal Relationship (Level 15)

Starting at 15th level, once during each of your turns when you hit a creature or object with a ranged attack using your curse armament, you can teleport to the nearest unoccupied space to the target. Your curse armament then reappears in your space.

### Curse Combination (Level 20)

At 20th level, when you take the Attack or Cast a Spell action on your turn or use your reaction to make an opportunity attack, you can make an additional attack with your curse armament as part of the same action or reaction.

### Ravenous Weapon (Level 20)

At 20th level, your curse armament can have up to two magic melee weapons consumed at the same time. If you attempt to feed it a third, it regurgitates your choice of one of the two weapons it currently has consumed.

If both of your curse armament's consumed weapons grant a bonus to attack and damage rolls using the weapon, you use the higher of the two bonuses, not the combination. For example, if your curse weapon has consumed a weapon +2 and a weapon +3, you will receive a +3 bonus to your attack and damage rolls using your curse armament, not a +5 bonus.

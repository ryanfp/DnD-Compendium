## Class Features

### Curse of Somnolence (Level 1)

You, or perhaps a loved one, angered a powerful spellcaster, hag, or other fey creature, causing them to curse you to sleep forever and wake no more. Whether you found a loophole in the curse's magic or you battled through a land of ephemeral dreams back to the world of the waking, you eventually regained consciousness. Now you spend your fleeting waking moments trying to live the life you've only been able to dream of. After your long slumber, you're trying to make the most out of your waking hours, but a quick nap does sound good right about now...

### Somnolence Ailments (Level 1)

As a creature accursed with a relentless need for slumber, you suffer the following ailments:

- You have disadvantage on saving throws against gaining exhaustion and falling unconscious. Additionally, you count as having half your current hit points for the purposes of the sleep spell and the fatigue caused by the [Fulminating Fatigue](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-somnolence-ultimateadventurer.md#Fulminating%20Fatigue%20(Level%201)) feature.  
- Sleeping is the only activity that counts as light activity for you. If you are a race that normally does not or cannot sleep, you can and must sleep.  

### Sleepwalker (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, when you become unconscious and have 1 or more hit points, you don't automatically fall prone. While you're unconscious in this way, you can move normally and sense creatures, objects, and other surroundings within 30 feet of you using your normal senses. You can perform any rote activity (such as riding a mount, reading a book, or keeping watch) in your sleep.

### Fulminating Fatigue (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, you have the ability to build a mounting fatigue in your enemies. As an action, you can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature gains `d10` fatigue.

While a creature has any amount of fatigue, it has a âˆ’1 penalty to ability checks and saving throws. If a creature's fatigue is equal to or greater than its current hit points, the creature falls unconscious (or is stunned, if the creature is immune to being unconscious). A creature remains unconscious (or stunned) until it takes damage or a number of hours equal to your accursed level have passed, at which point its fatigue is halved. A creature loses all fatigue when it finishes a short or long rest.

The amount of fatigue gained on a failed saving throw increases as you gain levels in this class. The fatigue gained increases by `d10` at 5th level (`2d10`) and again at 11th (`3d10`) and 17th (`4d10`) level.

### Curse Spells (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, your increasing mastery of your curse causes you to learn a particular spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Somnolence Curse Spells table. See the Spellcasting class feature for how curse spells work.

**Somnolence Curse Spells**

| Accursed Level | Spells |
|----------------|--------|
| 2nd | sleep |
| 5th | calm emotions |
| 9th | catnap |
| 13th | hallucinatory terrain |
| 17th | dream |
^somnolence-curse-spells

### Lucid Dreaming (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, you have a mystical mastery over the waking world informed by the time you spend lucid dreaming. When you sleep for at least 8 consecutive hours, you can learn any one spell of your choice that is of a level you can cast. Chosen spells count as accursed spells for you but don't count against your number of accursed spells you know. Immediately after you cast a spell you learned through this feature, you forget it. You also forget any spells you learned through this feature when you use it to learn spells again.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional spells when you use this feature. At 5th level, you learn a total of two spells. At 11th level, you learn a total of three spells.

### Sweet Dreams (Level 3)

Also starting at 3rd level, when you finish a long rest<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup> where you slept uninterrupted the entire time, you gain one relaxation level. You can have a maximum number of relaxation levels equal to your proficiency bonus. When you would take a level of exhaustion and you have one or more levels of relaxation, you lose a relaxation level instead.

In addition, you can use an action and expend any number of relaxation levels. When you do, you gain the following benefit of your choice:

- You have a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws for a number of hours equal to the number of relaxation levels expended.  
- You regain hit points equal to 5 x the number of relaxation levels expended.  
- You regain an expended spell slot of a level equal to the number of relaxation levels expended.  

Once you use this feature to gain a benefit, you can't gain the same benefit again until you finish a long rest<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup>.

### Night Terrors (Level 5)

Starting at 5th level, you can use an action to choose an unconscious or stunned creature within 30 feet to experience vivid nightmares, causing it to take `2d8` psychic damage. If taking damage would normally end the unconscious or stunned condition, this damage doesn't cause that to happen.

This damage increases by `d8` at 11th level (`3d8`) and again at 17th level (`4d8`).

### Deep Sleeper (Level 5)

Also starting at 5th level, you gain a total of two relaxation levels when you finish a long rest<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup> if you slept uninterrupted the entire time.

Once you reach certain accursed levels, you gain a further relaxation level when you finish such a long rest<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup>: 13th level (three relaxation levels) and 20th level (four relaxation levels).

### Golden Slumbers (Level 11)

Starting at 11th level, immediately after you take damage, you can use your reaction to fall unconscious until the start of your next turn or the next time you take damage, whichever comes first. While asleep, you have resistance to all damage except psychic. If you sleep until the start of your next turn, you wake with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your accursed level.

### Lucid Waking (Level 15)

Starting at 15th level, you can cast a spell you chose with your [Lucid Dreaming](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-somnolence-ultimateadventurer.md#Lucid%20Dreaming%20(Level%203)) feature without expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature to cast a spell, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup>.

### Rest and Recover (Level 20)

At 20th level, you can use an action to sleep deeply, spreading a contagious somnolence amongst those near you. When you do, you immediately fall unconscious. During this time, you have resistance to all damage except psychic and cannot be woken unless you wish to be. At the end of each of your turns for the duration, you gain a relaxation level and each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you is targeted as if you had used your Fulminating Fatigue feature on it. While you remain unconscious due to this feature, you can still use your action, though the only action you can take is to use your Night Terrors feature.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

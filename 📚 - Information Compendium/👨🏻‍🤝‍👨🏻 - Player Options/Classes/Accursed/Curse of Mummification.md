## Class Features

### Curse of Mummification (Level 1)

Upon your death, a necromantic ritual was performed on your body as it was buried. Your organs were removed and placed in canopic jars, your corpse treated with preserving oils and wrappings, and your body imbued with reanimating magics. After the ritual was completed, you were sealed in a temple or tomb to act as its guardian, only animating upon conditions set by the practitioner that performed your ritual.

Perhaps you earned this punishment by invading the crypt of a mummy lord, displeased the priest of a death cult or one who serves a god of death, or committed high crimes against a vengeful emperor. Regardless of how you became a mummy, upon one of your reanimations, you somehow regained self-awareness, found your organs and replaced them within yourself, and managed to return to a semblance of life while breaking the compulsion of the animating magicks. You've discovered that the workings used to preserve you have their perks, though, and that you still have access to a mummy's horrific powers...

### Mummification Ailments (Level 1)

As a creature whose corpse was accursed to rise as a mummy, you suffer the following ailments:

- Though your body has mostly returned to life, your skin still has the consistency of parchmentâ€”unnaturally dry and susceptible to flame. Whenever you take fire damage, the damage increases by an amount equal to your curse ability modifier (minimum 1).  
- Due to being trapped in a tomb or sarcophagus for so long, being in narrow spaces is uncomfortable for you. While you're in an area, such as a room or corridor, that is 5 feet or smaller in one or more dimensions, you have disadvantage on ability checks.  

### Preserved (Level 1)

At 1st level, the necromantic embalming process used to preserve your corpse for mummification continues to affect you. You no longer age, you require half as much food and water as normal, and it takes twice as long for you to suffocate.

### Rot Fist (Level 1)

Also starting at 1st level, you can wrap your fist in necromantic magic that rots its victim from within. As an action, you can make a melee attack roll with proficiency against a creature within your reach. You use your choice of Strength or Dexterity for the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes necrotic damage equal to `d8` + your curse ability modifier. If the creature isn't an undead or construct, it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

The necrotic damage increases by `d8` when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).

### Curse Spells (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, your increasing mastery of your curse causes you to learn a particular spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Mummification Curse Spells table. See the Spellcasting class feature for how curse spells work.

**Mummification Curse Spells**

| Accursed Level | Spells |

| 17th | contagion |

### Tomb Guardian (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you learn to tap into the necromantic magicks suffusing your body and the instincts imbued in your mummy form to remain constantly alert to danger. You require only half as much sleep as normal, and while you're conscious, you can't be surprised except by magical means. You also gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

### Dreadful Glare (Level 3)

Also at 3rd level, you rediscover the power to terrify your enemies with merely a look. As an action, choose one creature within 60 feet of you that can see you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours, unless you use your reaction and expend a spell slot to prevent the immunity.

### Terror and Decay (Level 5)

Starting at 5th level, when you use your [Dreadful Glare](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-mummification-ultimateadventurer.md#Dreadful%20Glare%20(Level%203)), you can use your [Rot Fist](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-mummification-ultimateadventurer.md#Rot%20Fist%20(Level%201)) as part of the same action this turn.

### Necromantic Sustainment (Level 11)

Starting at 11th level, when you would gain a level of exhaustion, you can use the energies that sustain you to prevent yourself from gaining it. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup>.

### Mummy Rot (Level 15)

At 15th level, the magicks injected by your [Rot Fist](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-mummification-ultimateadventurer.md#Rot%20Fist%20(Level%201)) become far more insidious. When you deal necrotic damage to a creature with your [Rot Fist](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-mummification-ultimateadventurer.md#Rot%20Fist%20(Level%201)), you can force it to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become cursed with mummy rot. The curse lasts until the cursed creature dies or the curse is removed by the remove curse spell or similar magic. A creature cursed with mummy rot can't regain hit points, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, and whenever it takes necrotic damage, its hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount. If a creature dies while cursed with mummy rot, its body turns to dust.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup> or you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use it again.

### Mummy Lord (Level 20)

At 20th level, you learn to draw on the full reservoir of the powers granted to you by the dark ritual that turned you into a mummy. You gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to necrotic and poison damage.  
- When a creature fails its saving throw against your [Dreadful Glare](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-mummification-ultimateadventurer.md#Dreadful%20Glare%20(Level%203)) by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed until the end of your next turn.  
- You can perform a ritual over the course of 1 hour to magically extract your heart without dying, or to return your extracted heart to your chest while you're touching it. The extracted heart has 1 hit point, 5 AC, and is immune to all damage except for fire damage. When you die, as long as your heart is intact and you aren't otherwise returned to life, you return to life in a new body that appears within 5 feet of your heart after 24 hours. The new body has full hit points. At the same time, your previous body falls to dust, with all of your equipment remaining in its space. If the heart is ever destroyed, you immediately know. When you finish a long rest<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup> while your heart is destroyed, you can cause a new one to appear in your space. You choose whether the heart appears within your body or outside of it.

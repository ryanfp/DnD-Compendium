## Class Features

### Curse of Misfortune (Level 1)

You, or one of your ancestors, managed to earn the ire of a powerful magical entity — whether it be a hag matron, a celestial deity, or an archmage — that cursed your family line with poor luck. You're constantly losing possessions as though they've vanished into the aether, you injure yourself in the most improbable of ways, and it always rains if you've forgotten your cloak. You've learned, however, that the magic that surrounds you simply alters probability, and have discovered that you can manipulate it and even potentially shift its polarity to good luck. Perhaps, if you gain enough control over this power, you may even be able to alter fate...

### Misfortune Ailments (Level 1)

As a creature accursed with supernatural bad luck, you suffer the following ailments:

- Whenever a creature scores a critical hit against you, it can roll one of the weapon or effect's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.  
- You suffer disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks. Once you fail such an ability check, this ailment doesn't affect ability checks you make using the same ability for 1 minute, or until you fail an ability check using a different one of these abilities.  

### Playing the Odds (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, you can use your curse's magicks to affect the probability of games of chance. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check involving a game of chance, such as using a dice set or playing card set, you can use your reaction to magically give the creature advantage or disadvantage on the ability check. Unless the target succeeds on an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your curse save DC, it doesn't know you manipulated the game with this feature.

### Unfortunate Accident (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, once during each of your turns when you use your [Jinx](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-ultimateadventurer.md#Jinx%20(Level%201)), you can choose to imbue the jinx with additional bad luck. If a target fails its saving throw against this [Jinx](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-ultimateadventurer.md#Jinx%20(Level%201)), it takes 1d8 force damage, the extra bad luck causing a seemingly random event to injure it. When a creature fails its saving throw against this imbued jinx, it counts as you hitting it with an attack for the purpose of your accursed class features and accursed spells. You must use this feature before the target makes its saving throw against the [Jinx](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-ultimateadventurer.md#Jinx%20(Level%201)).

The damage increases by `d8` when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).

### Curse Spells (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, your increasing mastery of your curse causes you to learn a particular spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Misfortune Curse Spells table. See the Spellcasting class feature for how curse spells work.

**Misfortune Curse Spells**

| Accursed Level | Spells |
|----------------|--------|
| 2nd | bless |
| 5th | enhance ability |
| 9th | [bestow blessing](/3-Content/Compendiums/spells/bestow-blessing-ultimateadventurer.md) |
| 13th | confusion |
| 17th | skill empowerment |

### Fortune Twist (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you learn to take finer control over your own luck, though the threads of fate aren't fond of being manipulated. When you fail an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll, potentially changing the failure to a success with your curse's magic. Once you use this feature, you can't use it to affect the same type of roll again until you fail a different roll of the same type.

For example, if you use this feature to reroll an attack roll, you can't use this feature on an attack roll again until you miss with a different attack roll.

### Unavoidable Accident (Level 5)

Starting at 5th level, when a creature succeeds on its saving throw against a jinx imbued by your Unfortunate Accident, it takes half the damage, but suffers no additional effects from your [Jinx](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-ultimateadventurer.md#Jinx%20(Level%201)).

### Miserable Company (Level 11)

Starting at 11th level, you can foist your curse's effects onto others. When another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or attack roll, you can use your reaction to magically impose disadvantage on the roll. If a creature can see you when you use this feature, it knows that you are the source of the bad luck.

### Fortunate Company (Level 15)

Starting at 15th level, you can bend fate to make others supernaturally lucky. When another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or saving throw, you can use your reaction to magically grant advantage to the roll. If a creature can see you when you use this feature, it knows that you are the source of the good luck.

### Sovereign of Fate (Level 20)

At 20th level, you become a master at weaving the threads of fate. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to use one of your Curse of Misfortune features, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

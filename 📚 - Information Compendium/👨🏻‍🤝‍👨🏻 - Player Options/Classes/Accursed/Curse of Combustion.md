## Class Features

### Curse of Combustion (Level 1)

Your body is an explosive with a fuse of unknown length, most likely due to angering a powerful fire entity like Elemental Fire Lord Imix, an archpriest of the Cult of Eternal Flame, an efreeti, or a god of fire like Kothuss. You never knew when it would finally be time for the first to burst out of you, annihilating you and everything in the immediate vicinity, but you could always feel the flames building in a slow crescendo within you, like it is using your body and soul as kindling. By some means, though, you learned to harness this inner inferno, and can now use it to your own ends. After all, fire is so beautiful to behold, and you cannot help but to wonder how gorgeous the world would look when bathed in your glorious flame...

### Combustion Ailments (Level 1)

As a creature accursed to spontaneously burst into flame on day, you suffer the following ailments:

- The flames trying to burst from within you give you a subdermal glow. You magically shed dim light<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup> to a range of 10 feet, and have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make to avoid being seen while this light is visible.  
- Whenever you lose concentration due to taking damage (even when you aren't concentrating on a spell), you take additional fire damage equal to your level, and each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to half your level. Fire damage you take from this ailment can't be reduced or prevented in any way. Once you take damage from this ailment, this ailment doesn't function until the start of your next turn, your inner flames needing to stoke.  

### Humanoid Torch (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, you can brighten your inner flame to further illuminate the world around you. As an action, you can magically cause yourself to shed bright light<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup> in a 20-foot radius and dim light<sup><span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">'24</span></sup> for an additional 20 feet. You can dismiss this light as a bonus action on your turn.

### Flame Burst (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, as an action, you can cause the magical flames burning within you to explode out. Each creature other than you within 5 or 10 feet of you (your choice each time to use this feature) must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `d8` fire damage.

The damage increases by `d8` when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).

### Curse Spells (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, your increasing mastery of your curse causes you to learn a particular spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Combustion Curse Spells table. See the Spellcasting class feature for how curse spells work.

**Combustion Curse Spells**

| Accursed Level | Spells |

| 5th | Aganazzar's scorcher |

### Igniting Touch (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you learn to concentrate the heat of your inner flame into your palm. As an action, you can magically ignite a flammable object you touch with your hand, provided it isn't being worn or carried by another creature.

You can also use this feature to attack your enemies without harming your allies. As an action, you can make a melee spell attack against a target within your reach. On a hit, the target takes fire damage equal to your [Flame Burst](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-combustion-ultimateadventurer.md#Flame%20Burst%20(Level%201)) damage + your curse ability modifier.

### Blast Wave (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, when you use your [Flame Burst](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-combustion-ultimateadventurer.md#Flame%20Burst%20(Level%201)), you can expend a spell slot to increase its radius and potency. Its radius increases to 20 feet for a 1st-level spell slot, to 30 feet for a 2nd-level, to 60-feet for a 3rd-level, to 90 feet for a 4th-level, and to 120 feet for a 5th-level spell slot.

Additionally, when you expend a spell slot with this feature, if a creature succeeds on its saving throw against the [Flame Burst](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-combustion-ultimateadventurer.md#Flame%20Burst%20(Level%201)), it takes half the damage.

### Overheat (Level 5)

Starting at 5th level, you can cause your flames to burn so hot that you even scorch yourself. Once during each of your turns when you deal fire damage with an accursed class feature or accursed spell, you can choose to take an amount of fire damage up to your accursed level (minimum 1). If you do, the damage roll increases by an amount equal to twice the fire damage you chose to take. Fire damage you take from this feature can't be reduced or prevented in any way, but doesn't require you to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration.

### Calculated Combustion (Level 11)

At 11th level, you gain enough control over your flames that you can create pockets of safety within them for your companions. When you use an accursed class feature or cast an accursed spell that deals fire damage, you can choose a number of creatures you can see up to half your accursed level. Each of the chosen creatures automatically succeeds on any saving throw it makes against the feature or spell this turn, and takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### White Hot (Level 15)

At 15th level, your flames become hot enough to burn objects resistant to fire. Your accursed class features and accursed spells ignore resistance to fire damage.

### Raging Inferno (Level 20)

At 20th level, whenever you deal fire damage to a target other than yourself with an accursed class feature or accursed spell, the target takes an additional `2d8` fire damage.

Additionally, when you use your [Overheat](/3-Content/Compendiums/classes/accursed-curse-of-combustion-ultimateadventurer.md#Overheat%20(Level%205)), the feature or spell ignores any immunity to fire damage that a target may have this turn.

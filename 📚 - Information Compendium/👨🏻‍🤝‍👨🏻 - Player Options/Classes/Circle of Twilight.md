I like the features of the Stars and Spores druid that expend a use of the Wild Shape, and Twilight druid feels even further away from a typical druid, so changing their Wild Shape into something else feels like a no-brainer to me. I also feel the Twilight druid lacks a little something at later levels, so I thought of how you might make it a bit more interesting. Thus I came up with the following additional feature for the Circle of Twilight druid:

Reaper's Agent: Starting at 2nd level, you've gained a mystical connection to the forces beyond the veil and can draw upon their powers. You can expend one use of your Wild Shape to conjure a spectral cloak and scythe. They remain on your person for the next 10 minutes and while they are present you gain the following benefits:

You hover above the ground, which still puts you within 5ft of the ground and any creature standing next to you, but lets you avoid hazard such as difficult terrain, caltrops, etc. At level 10 you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed

You can use your scythe to make melee attacks that are magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunities. Your scythe uses Wisdom as its attack modifier and deals 1D8+ your wisdom modifier slashing damage. This damage scales to 1D10 at level 10 and 1D12 at level 17.

Tell me what you think of this feature as an augmentation to the Circle of Twilight Druid and what you would tweak!

*A compiled list of all the various classes and subclasses scattered throughout my ever-growing collection of homebrew. A brief description is included. Their sources are listed with each subclass if they’re not in base 5e*

# Classes

> *Adventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dangerous places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can’t stand against.*
> 
> *Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.*

## [[Accursed]]

*Afflicted by a horrific curse but finds a way to take control, alleviating the worst of its effects and wielding its power for themselves. **(Source: The Ultimate Adventurer’s Handbook)*

*An accursed dedicates their time and willpower to find a way to make the magic of their curse work for them, though each in their own way. Some accurseds experiment in a lab or scour the world for forgotten lore, trying to find a ritual or alchemical concoction. Others turn to nature or faith, using prayer, meditation, or mindfulness to synthesize the curse's magic into their own being. And others still use sheer stubbornness to bend the curse to their will. Regardless of method, an accursed is one who has conquered their curse, drawing on its magic while managing its lingering side effects.*

### <u>Subclasses - Conquered Curses</u>

#### **Curse of The Created**
You were not born, nor were you cursed. Instead you lurched to life with electricity crackling in the air around you. This subclass is based on Frankenstein, granting you lightning augments to abilities. 
#### **Curse of Immortality**
Literally immortal, you return to life if dead at the start of each day. Jack of all trades with lots of knowledge due to being alive for forever
#### **Curse of Misfortune**
Cursed with bad luck, however you can also manipulate dice rolls and other “games of chance”. 
#### **Curse of Mummification**
You were turned into a mummy upon death, giving you necrotic damage and fear abilities.
#### **Curse of Petrification**
You were turned into a statue, and can change into this form at will. Grants you damage resistance and powerful slams and other weight/inertia based abilities.

## Barbarian

*Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multi-verse that manifest as a Rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.*

### <u>Subclasses - Primal Paths</u>

*Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.*
61-11=50
#### **Path of the Berserker**
For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end — that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being. You fall into your rage entirely to deliver a tide of powerful blows.
#### **Path of the Totem Warrior**
The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage. In some barbarians’ tribes, a totem animal is considered to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.
#### **Path of the Ancestral Guardian**
Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.
#### **Path of the Storm Herald**
All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.
#### **Path of the Zealot**
Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots — warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.
#### **Path of the Beast**
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian. Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal spirit or be descended from shape-shifters.
#### **Path of Wild Magic**
Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic.
#### **Path of the Battlerager**
Known as Kuldjargh (literally “axe idiot”) in Dwarvish, battleragers are followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.
#### **Path of the World Tree (Exclusive to 2024e)**
Barbarians who follow the Path of the World Tree connect with the cosmic tree Yggdrasil through their Rage. This tree grows among the Outer Planes, connecting them to each other and the Material Plane. These Barbarians draw on the tree's magic for vitality and as a means of dimensional travel.
#### **Path of the Colossus**<sup>VSS</sup>
Sometimes known as a war-hulk, a colossus barbarian is always on the front lines hefting massive weapons and sweeping away smaller combatants in their fury. To a war-hulk, strength is the only attribute that matters. Cunning is for the weak, faith is for the weak, speed is for the week, and so on. Victory is for the strong alone, and their rage is the purest path to strength. Path of the Colossus barbarians are able to grow to enormous size and crush their foes.
#### **Path of the Fin**<sup>VSS</sup>
Tribal communities exist all across the realms, with vastly different cultures and customers – with one steadfast certainty. Time and time again these tribes have a reverence for particular animals, some in the desert may follow the Jackal, or those in the jungle the Ape. It is in this tradition that the Path of the Fin, these warriors capture the bloodthirsty essence of the great Shark. An adherent to oceanic totems, bearing hills and rows of razor sharp teeth, they can sense blood – and fear. 
#### **Path of Heavy Metal**<sup>VSS</sup>
Armored only in face paint and studded belts, these fearless hellions are known for screaming their enemies into submission, trashing taverns, and turning any battle they’re involved in to a noisy, violent and short experience.
#### **Path of the Muscle Wizard**<sup>VSS</sup>
You’re a wizard! Just one with coincidentally massive, rippling muscles. You even have the big dumb hat and the book filled with gibberish and everything! You gently remind others, often by beating them to a pulp and cracking their bones, that your magical powers shouldn’t be questioned. You have the ability to cast “spells” with your “arcane powers”
#### **Path of the Rage Mage**<sup>VSS</sup>
Barbarians who find the spark of arcane talent and learn to channel their brute ferocity through magic, embark on the Path of the Rage Mage. Through their rage-fueled arcane might, such a barbarian possesses a uniquely calamitous fury, merging physical prowess with spell slinging in a warpath of fire, blades, and blood. 
#### **Path of Tranquility**<sup>VSS</sup>
You choose to walk the straight and narrow, embracing a zen philosophy of restraint and moderation, much in contrast with their furious brethren. Embraced by the fey and called “the serene”, these barbarians are calm, tactical warriors who issue swift retaliation instead of violent assaults. At the height of their power, the serene are one with nature, entering flow state at will to dispatch their foes with unmatched precision. 
#### **Path of the Blighted**<sup>UA</sup>
Embracing this path unleashes a primal fury intertwined with the corruptive energies of the cursed beings. As a Blighted Barbarian, you become an embodiment of their malevolence, channeling their sinister powers to devastating effect. Your body and spirit endure both physical and metaphysical transformations, enhancing your already formidable combat prowess. With each swing of your weapon, your strikes resonate with the otherworldly force that has possessed you, and your adversaries cower before the sheer terror emanating from your blighted form. Through this subclass, you tread a precarious path, balancing between embracing the cursed powers and preserving your own humanity amidst the darkness.
#### **Path of Booming Magnificence**<sup>TOH</sup>
Barbarians who walk the Path of Booming Magnificence strive to be as lions among their people: symbols of vitality, majesty, and courage. They serve at the vanguard, leading their allies at each charge and drawing their opponents’ attention away from more vulnerable members of their group. As they grow more experienced, members of this path often take on roles as leaders or in other integral positions.
#### **Path of Hellfire**<sup>TOH</sup>
Devils have long been known to grant power to mortals as part of a pact or bargain. While this may take the form of unique magic or boons, those who follow the Path of Hellfire are gifted with command over the fires of the Lower Planes, which they channel for short periods to become powerful and furious fighting machines.
#### **Path of Mistwood**<sup>TOH</sup>
The first barbarians that traveled the path of mistwood were elves who expanded upon their natural gifts to become masters of the forests. Over time, members of other races who saw the need to protect and cherish the green places of the world joined and learned from them. Often these warriors haunt the woods alone, only seen when called to action by something that would despoil their home.
~~**Path of the Dragon**<sup>TOH</sup>~~
	~~Few creatures embody the power and majesty of dragons. By walking the path of the dragon, you don’t solely aspire to emulate these creatures—you seek to become one.~~
#### **Path of the Herald**<sup>TOH</sup>
In northern lands, the savage warriors charge into battle behind chanting warrior-poets. These wise men and women collect the histories, traditions, and accumulated knowledge of the people to preserve and pass on. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Herald lead their people into battle, chanting the tribe’s sagas and spurring them on to new victories while honoring the glory of the past.
#### **Path of the Inner Eye**<sup>TOH</sup>
The barbarians who follow the Path of the Inner Eye elevate their rage beyond anger to glimpse premonitions of the future.
~~**Path of Thorns**<sup>TOH</sup>~~
	~~Path of Thorns barbarians use ancient techniques  developed by the druids of old that enable them to grow thorns all over their body. The first barbarians of this path fought alongside these druids to defend the natural order. In the centuries since, the knowledge of these techniques has spread, allowing others access to this power.~~
#### **Path of the Abomination**<sup>TCEE</sup>
There are whispers of barbarian tribes that possess otherworldly abilities, able to take on grotesque forms that defy the laws of the natural world. Regardless of their origin, these vile warriors often perform ancient and evil magic rituals of mutilation to transform their flesh. These actions warp both their bodies and minds in horrific ways that augment their already profound combat abilities.
#### **Path of the Alchemical Brute**<sup>TCEE</sup>
You move in polite society as well as anyone else, and are possessed of a level of intellect unusual to other barbarians. Through careful study and alchemical experimentation, you have learned to tap into the primal beast inside you, and manifest it in physical ways.
#### **Path of the Cosmic Juggernaut**<sup>TCEE</sup>
Barbarians who follow the Path of the Cosmic Juggernaut enter an intensely focused state when they enter a rage, channeling psychic energy and draw upon the Astral Plane to bend time and space itself.
#### ~~**Path of Dragonheart**<sup>TCEE</sup>~~
#### **Path of the Horned King**<sup>TCEE</sup>
Since ancient days, men have gathered to honor the gods of the hunt—but every so often, one of these cults is truly devoted to Baphomet, the Horned King, the father of minotaurs. Those that knowingly and willingly beseech the demon prince’s favor are endowed with ebony horns and a violent temper, making them little more than beasts hiding beneath a man’s flesh.
#### **Path of Infiltration**<sup>TCEE</sup>
To barbarians who follow the Path of Infiltration, rage does not mean battle cries and violent screams. Instead, it means deafening silence and uncertain shadows. Drawing upon magic from the Shadowfell, these infiltrators breathe in sound and light and hold it within, suppressing it as they lay waste to enemies, doors, and any other barriers between them and their goal.
#### **Path of the Demonshard**<sup>FEQ</sup>
Demonglass holds the essence of a fiend—pure malefic power yearning for release. A painful, and often lethal, ritual can embed a shard of demonglass in a mortal’s body; if the mortal survives, they can draw on the power of the fiend. No matter their intention, a Barbarian who walks the Path of the Demonshard may struggle to keep the fiendish malice contained.
#### **Path of the Blinking Pack**<sup>FCG</sup>
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Blinking Pack share in the nobility and majesty of the blink dogs they emulate. No matter where the abilities originate from, the Path of the Blinking Pack barbarian uses teleportation to hunt enemies and pack tactics to bring them down.
~~**Path of the Brewmaster**<sup>(LAL)</sup>
#### ~~**Path of the Empathic Ire**<sup>ECHH</sup>~~
#### **Path of the Curse**<sup>CCS</sup>
Barbarians that walk the Path of the Curse harbor a malicious presence within their body, which fuels their rage. When these barbarians enter a state of fury, this curse takes control, and at this point nothing will stop them from annihilating everything around them. Some of these barbarians accept this curse as a gift, and others fight with their curse— forcing it to work in their favor.
#### **Path of the Raging Mind**<sup>KT</sup>
The Path of the Raging Mind is a Barbarian that expresses their fury as a telekinetic manifestation. Their mind is so powerful that in their rage they warp the world around them. This is a psionic manifestation of a barbarian’s ability to focus their fury, and in battle this fury is weaponized as a deadly force that can fling about weapons and enemies alike.
#### **Path of the Exosuit**<sup>KT</sup>
Perhaps it is a lost piece of technology, such as long dead Warsmith’s cast off armor that has developed strange properties, or perhaps it is an alien symbiote of some kind, with its own goal or objective (perhaps as simple as harmlessly feeding off your rage or your foes). Perhaps it is something you find or something you make, but whatever its origin, it grants you terrifying capabilities on the battlefield.
~~**Path of Mutation**<sup>KT</sup>~~
#### **Path of Instinct**<sup>KT</sup>
While many Barbarians lose control when they rage, flying into wild tantrums, some operate in a state of cold absolute focus, becoming creatures of pure instinct and finely honed reflexes. Entering a void-like state of mind, they act almost without conscious thought, accomplishing superhuman feats and shrugging off hits. Though utter calm might seem less frightening than the frothing rage of their counterparts, true terror sets in once their foes witness the destruction such perfect focus can bring.
~~**Path of the Dragon**<sup>KT</sup>~~
#### **Path of the Bladestorm**<sup>KT</sup>
When a Path of the Bladestorm Barbarian walks onto a battlefield, those unprepared to withstand the rain of sharp steel ought to run and hide until the storm passes. They are Barbarians whose rage is such a transcendent force that their very weapons are restless embodiments of their destructive wrath. The ones who stay will have to face the winds of destruction and will soon be drenched by flying droplets of blood as the barbarian at the center of the maelstrom smashes, hacks and slashes at the strength of primal winds.
#### **Path of the Courageous Heart**<sup>XLNEE</sup>
For some adventurers, their internal reservoir of fearlessness and gallantry might border closer to foolhardiness. An intrepid do-gooder might take the first step down this path by complete accident, meddling in affairs they ought not and finding themselves unable to turn back. Their impromptu effectiveness in battle isn’t due to anger but rather matching pluck, tenacity, or stubbornness to shrug off the worst the enemy has to offer.
#### **Path of the Red Reaver**<sup>XLNEE</sup>
The barbarians that follow this path fuel their rage with this pursuit of purpose. For those that live long enough, their discipline becomes almost monk-like in its meditation, chasing their sense of self through the arteries of those they deem worthy in battle. As wizards live to slake their thirst for knowledge, barbarians who follow the Path of Red Reaver are usually drawn to the greatest challenge in the field, not for bragging rights, or even to turn the tide of battle, but to further discern their place in the veins of their world.
~~**Path of the Sacred Kin**<sup>XLNEE</sup>~~
#### **Path of the Swamp**<sup>BoE</sup>
The most fearsome denizen of the swamp isn’t a giant alligator, black dragon, or a gnarled treant, but a barbarian, a fearsome warrior imbued with all of the land’s malice. When the swamp is threatened by an external force, long- forgotten magic seizes a host, transforming them into a thing of crushing roots and choking vines, an avatar of the swamp’s vengeance.
#### **Path of the Accursed**<sup>CFSA</sup>
You managed to find a tome of blighted mysteries, filled with all the knowledge known to mortal men and the foulest of heresies, and stepped through the door to nowhere. Your mind fractured under the weight of the knowledge contained within and the horrible vistas of forgotten power that stood just within your feeble mortal grasp. You realized that the true source of your rage is both defiance and acceptance of the madness that lies within the Accursed Archive.
#### **Path of the Mercurial**<sup>CFSA</sup>
Your rage is instead a malicious spite that runs wild within your veins, bringing a cruel smile to your face and causing the shadows around you to writhe and twisty in sympathy–or agony. As you learn to walk the planes like the Shadowcat does, that cruel joy within your heart grows ever stronger, granting you powers unseen by mortal men. You are the stalking panther, the hunting lion, and the sly grin that appears even as your form fades away. Become nightmare. 
#### **Path of the Glacier**<sup>TGS</sup>
Born from the frigid and daunting Everglacier, barbarians who follow Path of the Glacier have learned to harbor the resolute stillness, patience, and unwavering determination and destruction of the icy landscape. These warriors trans- form their bodies into powerful moving bunkers that are as difficult to take down as they are to escape from.
#### **Path of the Infernal**<sup>TGS</sup>
You have found the conduit for your rage in something scarier than anything you’d find on the Material Plane. Your inner fury burns from the hells themselves, manifesting itself as a series of fiendish transformations and flames whenever you enter a rage. Regardless of your reason for having these abilities, one thing is certain: hell hath no fury quite like you.
#### **Path of Stone**<sup>TGS</sup>
Barbarians that tread the Path of Stone contain the fury of a tectonic force: slow to stir, but impossible to stop once begun. Stones crack beneath their feet, as they step with the weight of mountains, and their strikes carry the crushing might of an earthquake. With every swing these warriors make, they remind their foes that nothing stands forever against the movements of the earth.
~~**Path of the Unbreakable**<sup>E</sup>~~
#### **Path of the Juggernaut**<sup>TDR</sup>
Barbarians who follow the Path of the Juggernaut stand so resolutely that none can deter them, and they swing their weapons with such force that all who stand against them are flung aside. In might and in spirit, juggernauts are immovable object and unstoppable force all at once.
~~**Path of Blood**<sup>UAH</sup>~~
#### **Path of the Rune Sage**<sup>UAH</sup>
Using eldritch symbols painted or tattooed onto your body, you are capable of unleashing powerful arcane spells, altering and enhancing your ability to rage. 
~~**Path of the Skinchanger**<sup>UAH</sup>~~
~~**Path of the Stampede**<sup>UAH</sup>~~
#### **Path of the Sylvan Warden**<sup>UAH</sup>
Some barbarians are not marked by their loyalty to kin or tribe but by their loyalty to land and beast. These barbarians take up the role of stewards and protectors of the natural world, defending it rom those who would despoil it. Their admiration and emulation of the mysteries of nature allow them the ability to transform their rage into quietude and cast druidic spells. 
~~**Path of the War Chief**<sup>UAH</sup>~~
#### **Path of the Haze Rager**<sup>GTD</sup>
The first warriors who ventured into Drakkenheim were doomed. Few returned from these early expeditions, and those few who survived were forever changed by the experience. A rare few wrestle the madness of the Haze through a supernatural rage which allows them to channel the eldritch energies of delirium. These Haze Ragers thrive on the contaminated power of delirium, transforming madness and fear into a weapon.
~~**Path of the Old Gods**<sup>(GTD)</sup>~~
## Bard

*In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.*

### <u>Subclasses - Bard Colleges</u>

*In addition to the tradition of apprenticing with a master bard, the Sword Coast has some bardic colleges where masters teach students the bardic arts. The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.*

#### **College of Lore**
Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.

The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.
#### **College of Valor**
Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn’t pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.
#### **College of Creation**
Bards believe the cosmos is a work of art—the creation of the first dragons and gods. That creative work included harmonies that continue to resound through existence today, a power known as the Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Creation draw on that primeval song through dance, music, and poetry, and their teachers share this lesson: “Before the sun and the moon, there was the Song, and its music awoke the first dawn. Its melodies so delighted the stones and trees that some of them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing too. Learn the Song, students, and you too can teach the mountains to sing and dance.”

Dwarves and gnomes often encourage their bards to become students of the Song of Creation. And among dragonborn, the Song of Creation is revered, for legends portray Bahamut and Tiamat—the greatest of dragons—as two of the song’s first singers.
#### **College of Glamour**
The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.

The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, misusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.
#### **College of Swords**
Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.

Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful.
#### **College of Whispers**
Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.

Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses a bard’s reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.
#### **College of Eloquence**
Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art of oratory. These bards wield a blend of logic and theatrical wordplay, winning over skeptics and detractors with logical arguments and plucking at heartstrings to appeal to the emotions of audiences.
#### **College of Spirits**
Bards of the College of Spirits seek tales with inher­ent power-be they legends, histories, or fictions­ and bring their subjects to life. Using occult trap­pings, these bards conjure spiritual embodiments of powerful forces to change the world once more. Such spirits are capricious, though, and what a bard summons isn't always entirely under their control.
#### **College of Cantors**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
The cantors are a group of bards who lead the faithful through the praise and worship of the gods, becoming divine lyricists who heal others with their voice. Their music is directed towards the  heavens, with their instruments usually relating in some way to the god that they worship. Cantors are well loved within their respective communities, m and it is hard to find a talented cantor who will stay in one place for long, as the demand for their soothing hymns is widespread. 
#### **College of Graffiti**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
To many, the College of Graffiti is a nuisance, a band of hooligans that vandalize the city with no regard for the law. But bards who learn to tag know that graffiti is the single greatest art form. Graffiti artists use the entire city as their canvas, placing murals of inspiration where everyone can see them and personal tags where few will notice. Theirs is a bold, creative endeavor that, while illegal, breathes vibrancy into the city and emboldens those within it. 
#### **College of Jesters**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
Consummate humorists, acrobats, and orators, bards of the College of Jesters can often be found in royal courts and livening up the local tavern. These bards specialize in truth through biting humor, rather than stories or sonnets, and complement their razor wits with acrobatic stuns and other feats of showmanship. When among nobility, jesters offer off-kilter wisdom and fierce satire in equal measures. 
#### **College of the Mad God**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
In the middle of the night, you hear the music. It begins the same way every time, rising from a low drone into a deafening cacophony. The noise is maddening. In your waking hours, your fingers learn to imitate this melody and bring others to your level of psychosis.

You and others like you are called nightly by the beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes, the sounds of a mad god who echoes the pandemonium of the universe. Summoning you to do something you know not. 
#### **College of Masks**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
The masters of the mask are virtuoso performers who practice becoming the figure they portray, rather than merely imitating them. They believe all life is performed, rather than lived, and that to become an actor in this Great Play requires that one merely put on the metaphorical mask of another. 

To engage in this great stage drama, they carry with them a number of masks, each a potent magical artifact of a specific archetypal character or creature. 
#### **College of Romance**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
Paramours, seductors, and silver-tongued devils, these bards have turned the art of wooing someone into a science, which they ply to their advantage with mechanical efficiency and precision. Given the option, these bards would rather make love than war, knowing full well that an enemy turned ally is twice as effective as an enemy slain. 
#### ~~**College of Satire**<sup>(UA)</sup>~~

#### **College of the Shadowfell**<sup>(DAC)</sup>
Bards of the College of the Shadowfell specialize in the study of that realm, gleaming great knowledge of shadow magic in the process. These bards are few in number and their study is far harder than most, for knowledge of the Shadowfell is hard to come by. These bards occasionally gather in great libraries to share their knowledge, but most of their time is spent out in the world, looking for any glimpses of knowledge that might lead them to their goal.

These bards generally do not perform music, and are instead more inclined to creating stories and manufacturing histories, with most of these stories ending as dark as the realm they study.
#### ~~**College of the Ancients**<sup>(UA)</sup>~~

#### **College of Echoes**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
In the caverns beneath the surface of the world, sound works differently. Your exposure to echoes has taught you about how sound changes as it moves and encounters obstacles. Inspired by the effect caves and tunnels have on sounds, you have learned to manipulate sound with your magic, curving it and altering it as it moves. You can silence the most violent explosions, you can make whispers seem to reverberate forever, and you can even change the sounds of music and words as they are created.
#### **College of Investigation**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Bards pick up all sorts of information as they travel the land. Some bards focus on a certain type of information, like epic poetry, love ballads, or bawdy drinking songs. Others, however, turn to the shadowy occupation of investigating crimes. These bards use their knack for gathering information to learn about criminals and vigilantes, their tactics, and their weaknesses. Some work with agents of the law to catch criminals, but shadier members of this college use their dark knowledge to emulate the malefactors they have studied for so long.
#### **College of Shadows**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Some bards are as proficient in the art of espionage as they are in poetry and song. Their primary medium is information and secrets, though they are known to slip a dagger between ribs when necessary. Masters of insight and manipulation, these bards use every tool at their disposal in pursuit of their goals, and they value knowledge above all else. The more buried a secret, the deeper they delve to uncover it. Knowledge is power; it can cement empires or topple dynasties.

College of Shadows bards undergo careful training before they’re sent out into the world. Skilled in both music and manipulation, they’re the perfect blend of charm and cunning. The tricks they learn in their tutelage make them ideal for the subtle work of coaxing out secrets, entrancing audiences, and dazzling the minds of their chosen targets.
#### **College of Sincerity**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Bards of the College of Sincerity know it is easier for someone to get what they want when they mask their true intentions behind a pleasant façade. These minstrels gain a devoted following and rarely lack for company. Some of their devotees go so far as to put themselves at the service of the bard they admire. Though members of the college can be found as traveling minstrels and adventuring troubadours, they gravitate to large urban areas where their silver tongues and mind-bending performances have the greatest influence. Devious rulers sometimes seek out members of the college as counsellors, but the rulers must be wary lest they become a mere pawn of their new aide.
#### ~~**College of Tactics**<sup>(TOH)</sup>~~

#### ~~**College of Cat**<sup>(TOH)</sup>~~

#### **College of Harmony**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
Bards of the College of Harmony are masters of teamwork and bringing out the best in people. Often natural leaders, bards of this college sometimes favor coordinating the efforts of the party from a ranged position, while some choose to be on the front lines to inspire and encourage their allies.

Not only do their abilities allow them to increase the effectiveness of their comrades, these bards can bind the group together in magical harmony, allowing each of them to bestow protection on one another and to share in the beneficial effects the bard produces.
#### **College of Pantomime**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
The College of Pantomime is the home of bards who found that the world is a cacophonous place with too much noise and distractions to truly appreciate the Words of Creation or the magic which stemmed from it. They have therefore opted not to add their voices to the multitudes, instead choosing to remain silent, focusing instead on their movements and intentions to weave their magic as they trace the echoes of the Words of Creations which vibrate throughout the planes.
#### **College of Requiem**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
Bards of the College of the Requiem, often called lamenters or requiem singers, regardless of whether or not their requiem involves any singing, dedicate themselves to all things pertaining to death. This branches out into several different paths as some prefer funerary rites, while others keep the unnatural undead at bay. Other requiem singers still, have been known to turn this power to the bolstering of undeath, and as such, you can even see requiem singers in the armies of evil rulers that rely on the dead to bolster their ranks.
#### **College of Victory**<sup>(ToV)</sup>
Bards who align with the college of Victory are tacticians who thrive in the heat of battle. Whether rallying battalions of troops or skirmishing with smaller parties, these bards
Lead allies to glory with their commanding presence and strategic genius.
#### **College of the Road**<sup>(HWD)</sup>
Not an officially recognized college, the College of the Road represents the personal and eclectic sets of skills, knowledge, and techniques a wandering bard picks up along their journey. As inveterate jacks-of-all-trades, bards possess a variety of aptitudes in combat, magecraft, and general know-how, making them particularly well suited to learning a variety of different skills.

The College of the Road is sometimes a harsh teacher, but bards who follow this path often find themselves rewarded with a diverse array of useful tricks and tactics. Those who underestimate a bard from the College of the Road soon find that these “graduates” are full of surprises.
#### **College of Wands**<sup>(FEQ)</sup>
For a Bard of the College of Wands, spellcasting is an art and every duel is a symphony. Whether they use their skills as Entertainers, Smugglers, or Spies, a Bard can draw applause from an audience even as they lay an enemy low with a distracting word, a perfect gesture, and a surge of arcane power.
#### **College of Seasons**<sup>(FCG)</sup>
Bards of the College of Seasons get their power from the ever-changing flow of nature itself. This college studies the seasons as they interact in both the Material Plane and the Feywild. Songs composed from this college often have multiple movements, sometimes sounding different at first listen, but harmonies frequently exist in even the most discordant of melodies.

Bards from the College of Seasons withdraw from society to learn their craft. Some of these bards learn from elementals or spirits of the Feywild, while others find their muse in the wind that comes as the leaves change color. Often considered aloof even by other bards, the adherents of the College of Seasons usually find themselves more at home in a circle of druids than in a mead hall.
#### **College of the Dirge Singer**<sup>(EE)</sup>
Bards of the College of the Dirge Singer are trained to inspire their people and direct soldiers on the battlefield. Students of both history and war, dirge singers use tales of past glory and their knowledge of great victories to inspire their allies and provide keen strategic insight, directing allies to strike when enemies are weak.
#### ~~**College of Song**<sup>(ECHH)</sup>~~

#### **College of Weaving**<sup>(ECHH)</sup>
They call themselves weavers. Some would say they’ve completely lost touch with reality, that they truly don’t know what is real and what isn’t anymore. Weavers are bards who combine the art of acting with illusion spells to create immersive stories of their own design. They aren’t content to act only on the stage, under smokey lights and in front of stilted wooden scenery. No, the thrill of acting is far too great to restrict only to the theater. Instead, weavers choose to make the world around them at any given moment their stage, whenever, wherever, and with whomever passing by drawn into their drama. They can be anyone or anywhere they wish, and in a blink of an eye everything has shifted and they’re gone.
#### **College of Momentum**<sup>(CCS)</sup>
Bards of the College of Momentum live for music: sick beats, intense riffs, and powerful drops. These bards wield their songs as weapons, not only to entertain their fans, but to change minds.
#### **College of Thunder**<sup>(KT)</sup>
Some bards grow in talent, weaving beautiful ballads that move their listeners to tears. Some bards just turn up the volume. The College of Thunder is a path for those who want to be heard—to convey their message with great emphasis to as many people as possible. They often are keenly interested in innovating their instruments, finding new improvements that allow them to make new, louder, sounds... Even if the musicality of those sounds is sometimes debated by more classical artists.
#### **College of Fools**<sup>(KT)</sup>
The College of Fools is a motley lot, varying from bumbling beggars to the eyesores of a noble court, decked out in the finest eye-bleeding frippery. One can tell at a glance they are not to be taken seriously, but beneath the façade there is... Well, usually a fool, but also a sharp mind, quick hands, and an uncanny understanding of how to manipulate any situation.

The College of Fools is tolerated much like an assassin’s guild might be: a useful menace to society. Hiding in the brilliant outfits in plain sight more surely than darkened leather could hide them in the shadows, they gather information, poke and prod their enemies, and—just occasionally—toss a knife in the air and forget to catch it before it hits someone.
#### **College of Discord**<sup>(XLNEE)</sup>
Bards of the College of Discord yearn to take the performances to the next level. While some artists feel the need to prepare or learn progressions within a harmonic framework, the extemporaneous nature of the bard’s study encourages inventing variations in their musical repertoire mid performance. This practice usually bleeds into their outlook on life and, whether with accompaniment or solo, these bards are excited to delve into the unknown, no matter the vibe.
#### **College of Keys**<sup>(XLNEE)</sup>
Bards of the College of Keys believe that performance can manipulate anything, be it person, magic, or machine. Their preternatural charm allows these daring performers to delve into dungeons seething with traps, assured that they can use their words and song to protect themselves and allies. These bards often become spies and infiltrators, since no lock can stand up to their charms.
#### **College of Mourning**<sup>(XLNEE)</sup>
Bards of the College of Mourning specialize in easing the transition from life to death. While most bards derive their artistic catalogue from celebrating the lives of the valiant, mourning bards create a gateway for dead knights, faithful priests, and wise viziers who dedicated their lives in service, to accomplish any lingering obligations of the Material Plane. 

While some see romanticizing death as macabre, the college spent centuries observing religious rites and composing teachings of necromancy in prose to entreat the dead to remain long enough to fulfill their purpose. Mourning bards improvise their melodies to mask the cries and wails of grieving loved ones, and often turn dour occasions into celebrations of remembrance. Whatever their method, their purpose is always to complement the spirits’ shuffle to the afterlife in ceremonious display with arrangements of grace and style.
#### ~~**College of Springtide**<sup>(MCDM)</sup>~~

#### **College of Birdsong**<sup>(BoE)</sup>
As the legend goes, the first bards learned to sing from a nightingale, or perhaps a thrush. Each morning, the bird sang a splendid song that beckoned the sun to rise and flowers to bloom, and in turn every other bird joined the chorus. Bards which continue this tradition join the College of Birdsong and learn to sing as the nightingale once did.
#### **College of Portraiture**<sup>(CFSA)</sup>
Bards of the College of Portraiture are artisans first and foremost. Through your intensive study of anatomy and artistry, you’ve begun to unlock the secrets of instilling your soul into your creations. Your skill and talent in the manipulation of your life essence allows you to create and animate works of art in your own image. 
#### **College of Harbingers**<sup>(CFSA)</sup>
You are a disciple of the Storm Lord, an otherworldly entity that sails between the skies of countless worlds, consuming the souls of fallen heroes. To enter the ranks of these champions, it is typical to anchor oneself to a high place during a storm, and then throw themselves from the edge. The skies will tremble before your performance and your prowess shall become legend. 
#### **College of Cuisine**<sup>(HGMH)</sup>
Bards from the College of Cuisine are as prized in the kitchens of nobles as in the mess halls of the rank and file. While peace treaties might be signed over hoisin-glazed duck with sides of spiced jack-fruit and crispy shallots, it is the well-fed army that will win the war on a hearty oat and raisin porridge.

Such bards never struggle to find employment; they travel where their work is appreciated, be their diners highborn or down-to-earth.
#### ~~**College of Mixology**<sup>(LAL)</sup>

#### **College of Dance**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
Bards of the College of Dance tell stories and perform music without making a sound, choosing to instead move with fey- like grace and magic to evade harm and inspire others. These dances originate from the Festerwood, whose radiant spores and light made for miraculous performances and deadly hazards. These bards can be found anywhere from the local tavern to the highest levels of theater moving crowds to tears as quickly as rebellion. At every turn, they inspire others to be brave, move, and join in.
#### **College of Mercantile**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
Bards of the College of Mercantile are well versed in the artistry of cutting deals and enemies alike in order to come out ahead. Talented merchants, smugglers, and tradesmen alike all learn from this college in some form or another, using both silvered words and sharp cunning to inspire their allies and subvert competition. These calculated risk-takers travel the world to make their mark—and their fortune—by navigating treacherous landscapes, economies, and people. With even just a copper to their name, these bards are always worth their weight in gold.
#### **College of Tragedy**<sup>TDR</sup>
Not all grand stories conclude in triumphant victory. Many tales end with death and despair, and bards of the College of Tragedy know that sorrow and pathos are emotions just as potent as joy and delight. These bards specialize in the power of tragic storytelling, weaving words and spells together to dramatic and devastating effect.
#### ~~**College of Beasts**<sup>UAH</sup>~~

#### **College of Canticles**<sup>UAH</sup>
Most bards are content to amuse and entertain, but those in the College of Canticles lend their musical talents to the worships of the gods. These bards spread divinely inspired dogma and lead hymns, borrowing a measure of their god’s power to bolster their allies. While clerics may be the face of religious institutions, rarely are they as successful at winning converts as bards of this college. 
#### ~~**College of Drama**<sup>UAH</sup>~~

#### **College of Fortune**<sup>UAH</sup>
Bards in this college have a reputation as instigators that isn’t entirely justified. High rollers don't go looking for trouble, they just have a habit of provoking fellow party members into taking long shots that don't always pan out. Despite that, no bard has a better chance of helping their companions clutch victory from the jaws of defeat. The smart bet, whether against the house or not, is always on the bards of this college. 
#### **College of Pantomime**<sup>UAH</sup>
Mimes are performers who believes the purest form of entertainment does not require sound, but only immaculate use of facial expressions and body language. A sufficiently skilled mime can ascend their pantomime into minor reality warping, whether it be to eschew the verbal components of spells or to create invisible magical constructs with which they and others interact. 
#### **College of Puppetry**<sup>UAH</sup>
Bards in the College of Puppetry specialize in entertaining with puppets and marionettes. Not content to master exclusively mundane skills on their subject of interest, these bards, called puppet masters, learn to create their own animated marionette companion. Every companion is painted and decorated unique to its puppet master – most are whimsical, some are intimidating, and others are unsettling. 
#### **College of Masks**<sup>(OTG)</sup>
To be a bard from the College of Masks is  to be a theater actor capable of losing themselves in a role by using masks imbued with magic. Through these masks, bards can mimic others and even take on attributes of the personas their masks depict. 
#### **College of the Doomsayers**<sup>(GTD)</sup>
Bards of this college revel in the fear and despair of others. They have foreseen the end of times, and use their gifts of prophecy to instill terror in those who hear their words. These bards command an audience like any other, but their craft is that of a mad prophet, and their poems and songs echo dissonant rattlings of hopelessness and suffering. Those who hear the mad ramblings are stricken with fear, lose their wills, and fall into madness.
## Beastheart
*A beastheart is an adventurer who forms of bond of friendship with a wild creature, who draws power from that bond as it strengthens over time. Working as a team, a beastheart and their faithful companion can take on even the most dangerous adventures, challenging any monsters and overcoming any obstacles.*

*The connection a beastheart and their companion share isn’t just one of love and admiration. It’s a mystical bond that allows the beastheart to harness their companion’s fury, might, and instincts for survival. When their companion is enraged, a beastheart channels that ferocity into supernatural deeds of martial prowess. In return, the wild companion can harness the beastheart’s focus and direction* ***(Source: Beastheart and Monstrous Companions - MCDM)***

### <u>Subclasses - Companion Bonds</u>

*While every beastheart and companion share a special bond, the friendship between these partners can be rooted in many different aspects of the wild world. A companion bond represent s this specific  connection and shared power. Some beasthearts and companions live to unleash their inner fury, while others embrace the silence of the hunt. Another duo might bond over their need to protect nature or their pack, while a different beastheart might use their companion’s rage to harness the powers of Hell itself*

#### **Ferocious Bond**
Some beasthearts and companions feel closest when they abandon all control and let instinct guide their every move. When your companion enters a rampage, you feel every moment of their brutality, inspiring you to a battle fury all your own. 
#### **Hunter Bond**
You and your companion share a love of the hunt. The pair of you are silent stalkers working together to take down prey of all sizes, whether to feed your friends or to destroy your enemies. Many beasthearts with this bond used ranged weapons to attack prey from afar while their companion closes in for the kill. 
#### **Infernal Bond**
You and your companion share a deep connection with each other…and with the Seven Cities of Hell! It might be that you work in the service of a devil, that you both spent time imprisoned in Hell before clawing your way out together, or simply that you bonded with a fiendish companion born in the Lower Planes. Whatever the case, you are connected to the Seven Cities and can use your companion’s ferocity to unlock infernal magic. 
#### **Primordial Bond**
You and your companion share an especially deep connection with the magic of the natural world, and it’s building blocks. By harnessing the fury of your companions, you can wield the primal power of the elements against your foes. 
#### **Protector Bond**
Nothing is as important to you and your companion as your pack. The bond you both share sharpens your offensive and defensive prowess, letting you put your bodies and lives on the line to protect your allies and those who travel with you.

## Blood Hunter

*Often feared or misunderstood, driven by an unending drive to destroy the wicked, blood hunters are clever, arcane warriors who have bound their essence to the dark creatures they hunt. Armed with the rites of forbidden blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for the cause, they protect the realms from the shadows, ever vigilant to avoid becoming the same monsters they vow to hunt.*

*Through careful study and practice, blood hunters have honed the rites of hemocraft into their combat prowess, forfeiting a facet of their health to infuse their weapons with powerful blood magic and summoning the elements to envelop their strikes. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force against the terrors that threaten the innocent.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Blood Hunter Orders</u>

*There are a handful of secretive orders of blood hunters that guard their cryptic techniques and rituals. One must adhere to one of these orders to even be granted access to the Hunter’s Bane rite that starts their journey, and only once they’ve proven their dedication and ability will the secrets of the order begin to be revealed. It’s within these small, enigmatic sects that the real power of a blood hunter is learned.*
10
#### **Order of the Ghostslayer**
The Order of the Ghostslayer is the oldest of the orders having originally rediscovered the secrets of blood magic and refined them for combat against the scourge of undeath. Ghostslayers seek out and study the moment of death, obsessing over the mysteries of the transition and how it can become corrupted by unholy powers to rise once more. Tuning their abilities to annihilator such abominations, these zealous blood hunters seek out the sources of such necromantic energies, intent to destroy them wherever they arise. 
#### **Order of the Lycan**
Of the many terrible curses that plague the realm, few are as ancient or as feared as Lycanthropy. Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wicked beast. The Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who undergo “The Taming”, a ceremonial inflicting of lycanthropy from a senior member. These hunters then use their abilities to harness the power of the monster they harbor without losing themselves to it.  Through intense honing of one’s own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order’s blood magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form for short periods of time. 

Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust. 
#### **Order of the Mutant**
The process of the Hunter’s Bane is a painful, scarring and sometimes even fatal experience. Those that survive find themselves irrevocably changed, enhanced. Some found their experience exalting, embracing the ability to alter one’s own physiology through a combination of hemocraft and corrupted alchemy. 

Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters began to emerge, one that focused on brewing toxic elixirs to modify their capabilities in battle, altering their blood and, over time, become something beyond what they once were. They called themselves the Order of the Mutant. Researching their targets to know their strengths and weaknesses, these blood hunters can alter their biology to be best prepared for the coming conflict. 
#### **Order of the Profane Soul**
Those who’ve taken to the Order of the Profane Soul have seen the limits of hemocraft against the most ancient and cruel fiends and terrors of the world. Unable to pursue beings of such power, with creatures able to vanish amongst the nobles with a trace, or bend the mind of the most stalwart warrior with but a glance, this order trusted in their resilience and delved into this same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to combat the greater. While they may have traded a part of themselves, members of this order believe the power gained far outweighs the price, for even devils now quake when they know they’ve drawn the ire of the Order of the Profane Soul. 
#### **Order of the Courser**<sup>(ECHH)</sup>
Coursers are hunters of humanoids and monsters alike, focusing on tracking, hunting, and slaying their prey with pistols created through hemocraft magic. A courser always finds its quarry and it is said that if a courser comes for you, you best run towards them for there is no escape. If you somehow do manage to outrun a courser, their pistols fire pure magic that none can outrun. Many coursers find work as bounty hunters, where the supply of worthy quarries never runs dry.
#### **Order of the Lich Hunter**<sup>(ECHH)</sup>
While many blood hunter orders dedicate themselves to eradicate diabolical threats, both large and small, the Order of the Lich Hunter hunts those who practice irresponsible or dangerous magic. From the lonely hut with a mischievous witch to the murderous dungeon with an ancient lich, you will find a lich hunter nullifying the arcane as they drive their crackling weapon through the heretic.
#### **Order of the Dragoon**<sup>(UAH)</sup>
Dragon slaying is a discipline that dates back eons, originating the first time a scaled shadow loomed over humanoid prey. Dragons, however, are not easy targets. For they have annihilated and struck fear in the hearts of many glory hounds that have come for their heads. Seeking success where their predecessors have failed, blood hunters of the Order of the Dragoon aim to use these predators’ powers against them. 

With the hemocraft granted by the Hunter’s Bane, this order drinks dragon blood and binds it to their own, strengthening their bodies and utilizing draconic abilities such as the fearsome breath weapon. They make mighty leaps to strike their ancient quarry from the skies, and won’t stop until humanoids no longer fear shadows passing overhead. 
#### **Order of the Eye**<sup>(UAH)</sup>
The order of the Eye exhorts that information is the ultimate weapon, teaching that knowing one’s enemy is the greatest step one can take to destroying them. Hundreds of years ago, the Order’s founders began hunting beholders, both to put an end to the evils the ocular monsters wrought and to ransack the creatures'’ treasure rooms for the petrified specimens and ancient texts contained within them. Annexing the lairs as the Order’s bases and choosing not to waste the corpses of the lairs’ previous owners, these blood hunters developed a hemollurgic process to create new life from beholder eyestalks and bond the alchemical creatures to members of the Order through the sharing of blood. 

In the centuries since, the Order of the Eye has become an expansive information network of spies that operates in shadow throughout the Material Planes. Working in pairs of hunter and bonded eye spy, they seek to discover and eradicate all evil that secrets itself in the hidden pockets of the multiverse. 
#### **Order of the Giantfeller**<sup>(UAH)</sup>
Giants are ancient foes of many humanoid races, believing themselves to be superior simply due to their immense size. Blood hunters in the Order of the Giantfeller undergo unusual medical procedures that assimilate components of dissected giant organs into their own body. Using the power of their blood magic, they tap into the latent magic of these titanic infusions to steal a portion of the elemental power of giants and grow to unnatural sizes. The best way to fight a giant, they reckon, is to become one. 
#### **Order of the Infected Mind**<sup>(UAH)</sup>
For untold millennia, mind flayers and their elder brain overlords have enslaved many peoples through mind control, and forcibly converted many others through the process of ceremorphosis. The Order of the Infected Mind is dedicated to the systematic destruction of this illithid scourge, intentionally allowing mature illithid tadpoles to burrow into their brains to better understand their prey. Unlike standard victims of ceremorphosis though, this order brews their Hunter’s Bane to cause it to subdue and subsume the tadpole, turning it into a psionic weapon under the hunter’s control. 
## Bloodrager
*Bloodragers are warriors first and foremost, but warriors whose fight is fueled by their unique ancestry. Each Bloodrager's magic is powered by their bloodline, while their martial skills are governed by their discipline. Their magic unfolds when they tap into their bloodline's power, but even when that energy is spent, they are fearsome and capable fighters.* 

*A bloodrager may not have the full arcane might of their sorcerous cousins - their bloodlines do not express themselves so directly and yield a less focused and more primal style of spellcasting. But with axes, blades, and fists to fall back on, a bloodrager is no less deadly a combatant.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Blood & Blade</u>

*Your character is empowered from the beginning by their bloodline - a secret power hidden in their heritage, determining their magic and granting supernatural might. But they train in the way of their discipline, mastering their weapons and learning techniques for channeling that power through battle.*<sup>(SMR)</sup>
#### Mystic Bloodlines
*Bloodragers have a variety of innate bloodlines, sources of magical power which they inherit. You may choose which bloodline your bloodrager bears from the options listed below*
##### Gravemarked Bloodline
You bear a deathly curse, your heritage tainted by the stink of undeath. Perhaps you descend from a line of foul necromancers, or your ancestor crossed a mighty lich. Or maybe you yourself died and were barely brought back from the brink. Whatever the reason, your skin is pallid and your blood pumps slower than it ought.
##### Draconic Bloodline
Your blood is invested with the power of a mighty dragon. Perhaps your ancestor was granted a boon of draconic magic, or maybe a shapeshifted dragon even played a part in your family tree. Regardless of its source, you feel a great wyrm's power pulsing in your veins.
##### Scintillant Bloodline
Some bloodragers know exactly where their magic comes from, or at least have a good hunch. Scintillant bloodragers rarely do. Your powers are chaotic and unpredictable, turning you into a vessel of pure magic. Wild, shimmering magic pulses in your veins, unleashing itself at every opportunity
##### Celestial Bloodline
Your blood is mingled with that of a mighty celestial. Perhaps a deva stands in your family tree, or a member of your line was the chosen of a good-aligned deity. Your bloodline carries a power of holy radiance, which flows through you and finds expression in battle.
##### Jotun Bloodline
Some bloodragers carry the blood of giants in their veins. Whether changed by runic magic or carrying a long-lost titan's blessing in their veins, these bloodragers are able to call upon the powers of giantkin. They are titans of the battlefield, able to mark runes and grow to colossal size. Warriors of this bloodline tend to prefer the term "Jotun" over "Giant", using the language of these titanic beings.
##### Fiendish Bloodline
Your blood pulses with a fiery heat, tainted with the power of the lower planes. Whether due to a corrupted ancestor, a dark bargain, or some other vile source, your magic is empowered with a fiendish touch.
#### **Bloodrager Disciplines**
*Bloodragers specialize in certain combat disciplines, honing their battle skill even as they channel arcane power. You may choose which discipline your bloodrager follows from the options below.*
##### Ravager Discipline
Ravagers are bloodragers who fight with brutality, dealing as much damage as possible. They are often heedless of their own health, willing to suffer grave wounds as long as they can inflict worse on their foes. They frequently specialize in great weapons, choosing the deadliest tool for the job.
##### Reaver Discipline
Reavers are frenzied attackers, subscribers to the notion that more attacks are always more effective. Their focus is typically oriented around one target at a time - rather than laying about with a great weapon, they tear through one target at a time.
##### Meditative Discipline
Meditatives are disciplined bloodragers - warriors with an orderly mind and a regimented approach to combat. Their blood trance is almost like a dance, motion and attack and spellcasting all flowing together as if set to a song. Legend tells of elite units of sorcerer-soldiers, whole regiments of meditative bloodragers in service to ancient kingdoms.
##### Tempered Discipline
Tempered bloodragers take self-discipline to an extreme. Their combat style stresses holding back, feigning weakness, before spotting the enemy's weakness and landing a sudden and decisive blow. Their abilities are nearly mythic, with the amount of force they can put into a single blow.
##### Bombardier Discipline
Bombardier bloodragers are reckless warriors, mad alchemists who brew potions and hurl grenades on the battlefield. They throw dangerous concoctions or empowering mists in turn, rarely taking much care as to who's on the receiving end. But as a result, they have perhaps more faculty than any other for suddenly changing the balance of combat, crippling multiple foes with a fearsome blast.
##### Feral Discipline
Some bloodragers are so steeped with magic that it touches their minds, launching them into a savage fury in combat. Ferals can even transform themselves, twisting their hands into wicked claws and making their very bodies into weapons. They offer perhaps the purest expression of their blood trance, becoming veritable monsters on the battlefield.
##### Mystic Discipline
Some bloodragers choose to focus on their magical abilities, honing their sorcery until spellcasting is as natural as breathing. Mystics can channel their bloodline magic into arcane bolts of power, allowing them to eschew weapons entirely if they so choose.

## Cardcaster
*The wisdom of the Tarot is well known by many a fortune teller but these dabblers in mysticism only scratch the surface of the power contained within the cards of fate. Unlocking the energies within, cardcasters tease out destiny’s strands to work magic upon the world whether to tell the future, defend themselves, subdue foes, or achieve the impossible.*

*To a cardcaster, there is nothing more real than their tarot deck, the symbols on its cards as actual and impactful as the wind in the air or a rushing river. They are both the overseers and agents of destiny, driven to adventure by powers beyond their control—forces most people are not even aware exist. To truly embrace the ways of the cardcaster one must work to understand fate, whether to act in accordance with – or directly against. This dance between the cosmic forces of the universe result in a vibrant struggle to achieve true free will. **Source: The Masterclass CODEX*** 

### <u>Subclasses - Face Cards</u>

*In addition to the major arcana, a tarot set also consists of the minor arcana—the lesser secrets. The cardcaster draws power from these as well, primarily from a face card of their preferred suit.*
#### **Knight of Swords**
The Knight of Swords embody mental force and determination—the will envisioned as a blade. Cardcasters who focus on the brave Knight draw the sword to become warriors in their own right. 
#### **Princess of Wands**
Wands, often depicted as sprouting sticks, embody the magical power of creation. The Page, or Princess, of Wands enthusiastically explores her esoteric power, and those who focus on her develop an even greater command of their tarot deck. 
#### **Queen of Chalices**
Cups, also called Chalices, represent emotions, particularly love. Guided by the Queen of Chalices, the cardcaster’s flowing affection rallies their allies and keeps their foes at bay. 
#### **King of Coins**
Pentacles, also called Coins, call you to invest in practicality and worldliness. Their powers pertain to thrift, wealth, pragmatism, and taking joy in the here-and-now. Those who strive for the success of the King of Coins embrace the safe—and lucrative—options.
#### **Jack of Beasts**
In forgotten corners of the world, certain cardcasters practice the forbidden art of monster tarot. Their decks are comprised of strange suits and faces, each of which contain the trapped spirits of monsters. These cardcasters focus on the Jack of Beasts to unleash the creatures within. 
## Cleric
*Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic. Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.*

*Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.*

*Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.*

### <u>Subclasses - Divine Domains</u>

*In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.*

*Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.*
#### **Knowledge Domain**
The gods of knowledge — including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and Thoth — value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.
#### **Life Domain**
The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy — one of the fundamental forces of the universe — that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).
#### **Light Domain**
Gods of light — including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Re-Horakhty — promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul’s improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.
#### **Nature Domain**
Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.
#### **Tempest Domain**
Gods whose portfolios include the Tempest domain — including Talos, Umberlee, Kord, Zeboim, the Devourer, Zeus, and Thor — govern storms, sea, and sky. They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods of earthquakes, some fire gods, and certain gods of violence, physical strength, and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.
#### **Trickery Domain**
Gods of trickery — such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and Loki — are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.
#### **War Domain**
War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.
#### **Death Domain**
The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the underworld (Hades and Hel).
#### **Twilight Domain**
The twilit transition from light into darkness often brings calm and even joy, as the day’s labors end and the hours of rest begin. The darkness can also bring terrors, but the gods of twilight guard against the horrors of the night.

Clerics who serve these deities—examples of which appear on the Twilight Deities table—bring comfort to those who seek rest and protect them by venturing into the encroaching darkness to ensure that the dark is a comfort, not a terror.
#### **Order Domain**
The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to the laws that govern a society, an institution, or a philosophy. Clerics of Order meditate on logic and justice as they serve their gods, examples of which appear in the Order Deities table.

Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws establish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability, and if those who lead fail to protect the law, they must be replaced. In this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that create order and security in a chaotic multiverse.
#### **Forge Domain**
The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.
#### **Grave Domain**
Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.
#### **Peace Domain**
The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing. See the Peace Deities table for a list of some of the gods associated with this domain.

Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics’ blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another’s burdens, and the clerics’ magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.
#### **Arcana Domain**
Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.

The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and Wee Jas of Greyhawk.
#### **Destruction Domain**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
Some gods revel only in the crushing of walls and the burning of cities. These gods of destruction, critical counterparts to the gods of creation and mercy, need not be evil, but have a strong tendency toward chaos and enforcing the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

Clerics who follow such deities often have a deep personal connection with their chosen god. In some cases, they were spared from destruction in order to wreak it upon the world; in others, they have pleaded with the god for priesthood to destroy a single foe. Others still simply worship their god out of reverent fear. 
#### **Madness Domain**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
Your divine powers originate with the Madgod, a being of paranoia, mayhem, and psychosis. Every deranged thought or uncontrolled flight of fancy empowers the Madgod, who cares little for the logic of other godly domains. That is, of course, because the Madgod is a squirrel living outside the kingdom who once told you the secret of divine power is actually to collect enough fresh boysenberries, but never to eat them, and that it helps to have a good horse at your side. And lo, the rules of reality slipped away and you realized the wisdom of the Madgod’s words. It all makes sense if you think diagonally and squint your ears the right way!
#### **Pestilence Domain**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
You worship gods who favor corruption and plague, the Domain of Pestilence, for though you are ravaged by disease, it does not harm you. Like a virus, you move through the population, spreading your Festering Faith to all who will listen. Unlike a virus, there is no immune system from the Festering Faith, only complete acceptance. 
#### **Rum Domain**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
Where rum flows easily, the gods of merriment abound. Clerics of the Rum Domain feel the fuzzy warmth of strong drink not as sinful excess, but as praise to the gods of good times, which they worship often and with abandon. They look to spread their merry religion and the good times with it, bringing all to peace and happiness, a few nights of drunken revelry at a time. 
#### **Travel Domain**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
The realm of vagabonds, merchants, and adventurers, the gods of the travel domain are popular among any who frequent the roads or sail the seas. Evangelicals and the traveling priests of inhospitable regions also tend to represent the gods of travel. 
#### **Wealth Domain**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
Being one of the most popular pursuits of humanoids the world over, it should not come as a surprise that the accumulation of material wealth is governed by its own deities. Sitting at the confluence of industry and fertility, gods of wealth are assiduous in demanding tribute, but pay back their most loyal followers generously, showering them with gold. 
#### **Unity Domain**<sup>(UA)</sup>
A sense of oneness shines at the heart of healthy communities, whether bound together by friendship, blood, faith, or some other uniting force. The gods of unity deepen such bonds and delight in their strength.

Clerics of these gods preside over marriages and other familial bonding customs, but they also nurture the emotional bonds of friendship and camaraderie. Their divine blessings bolster and protect allies in battle through these deep bonds and turn aside malign influences.
#### **Blood Domain**<sup>(UA)</sup>
The gods of blood are patrons of all varieties of slaughter— including war, battle, murder, and even hunting—and accept any shedding of blood as an offering to their domain. They are the patrons of warriors, particularly those of a more chaotic disposition. While many clerics that follow a blood deity resemble deranged, blood-thirsty cultists, others are comparable to the followers of particularly violent war deities. Examples of the deities of this domain are Bhaal, the Lord of Murder, and Shezmu, the Lord of Blood.
#### **Night Domain**<sup>(UA)</sup>
Gods of the night—such as Selûne, Shar, Tharizdon, Takhisis, and Hecate—serve as both creators of light and harbingers of darkness, with moon goods focusing on the former and darkness gods on the latter. These gods serve as patrons of all alignments; their clerics serve as both righteous defenders of the weak, as well as deceptive thieves and assassins. Either way, these clerics excel in both melee combat and spellcasting, always using the cover of darkness to their advantage in both their battles and their attempts at subterfuge.
#### **Black Powder Domain**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
The Black Powder domain focuses on the explosive, unpredictable, and destructive capacity of black powder. Deities with a vested interest in alchemy or deities who revel in destruction can claim influence over this domain. Deities of destruction need not be evil; such gods may represent natural chaos and destruction, reveling just as much in the unpredictable destructive capacity of black powder as in the chaotic destruction wrought by a volcanic eruption. In areas where warfare involves alchemical weapons or firearms, gods of war might also claim influence over this domain.
#### **Hunt Domain**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Many terrible creatures prey on the villages, towns, and inns that dot the forests of Midgard. When such creatures become particularly aggressive or can’t be dissuaded by local druids, the settlements often call on servants of gods of the hunt to solve the problem.

Deities devoted to hunting value champions who aid skillful hunters or who lead hunts themselves. Similarly, deities focused on protecting outlier settlements or who promote strengthening small communities also value such clerics. While these clerics might not have the utmost capability for tracking and killing prey, their gods grant them blessings to ensure successful hunts. These clerics might use their abilities to ensure their friends and communities have sufficient food to survive difficult times, or they might enjoy the sport of pursuing and slaying intelligent prey.
#### **Mercy Domain**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Mercy can mean promoting healing instead of harm, but it can also mean ending suffering with a quick death. These often-contradictory ideals are the two sides of mercy. The tenets of deities who embody mercy promote ways to end bloody conflicts or deliver healing magics to those in need. While mercy for some may be benevolent, for others it is decidedly not so. More pragmatic mercy gods teach the best method to relieve the agony and torment brought on by monsters and the forces of evil is to bring about the end of that evil.
#### **Portal Domain**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
You have dedicated yourself to the study and protection of the doors, gateways, and rips in the boundaries between the physical world and the infinite planar multiverse. Stepping through portals is a sacred prayer and woe betide any who seek to misuse them.
#### **Serpent Domain**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
You embody the deadly, secretive, and mesmerizing nature of serpents. Others tremble at your majesty. You practice the stealth and envenomed attacks that give serpents their dreaded reputation, but you also learn the shedding of skin that has made snakes into symbols of medicine.
#### **Shadow Domain**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
The shadow domain embraces the darkness that surrounds all things and manipulates the transitory gray that separates light from dark. Shadow domain clerics walk a subtle path, frequently changing allegiances and preferring to operate unseen.
#### **Vermin Domain**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
You exemplify the cunning, stealth, and invasiveness of vermin (rodents, scorpions, spiders, ants, and other insects). As your dedication to this domain grows in strength, you realize a simple truth: vermin are everywhere, and you are legion.
#### **Wind Domain**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
You have dedicated yourself to the service of the primordial winds. In their service, you are the gentle zephyr brushing away adversity or the vengeful storm scouring the stones from the mountainside.
#### **Frost Domain**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
Gods of the cold and north, such as Auril, Iborighu, Thrym, and Ulutiu, are, like their element, often severe and demanding. These gods are not usually worshipped for their benevolence, but instead prey upon those who merely wish to survive the unforgiving tundra. Clerics to these gods may not be the warmest people, but they are often seen as saviors to northern settlements that rely on their blessings. These boons are not free though, and clerics of these gods may be sent to gather offerings in return for helping people survive.
#### **Inquisition Domain**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
Most clerics are pillars of their community, overseeing worship, healing, and religious rites in their god’s name. However, all faiths have rules, acts which are seen as taboo and creatures declared anathema. When violations appear, the inquisitors follow, finding the violators and enforcing the law with divine wrath and the point of a sword.

Inquisitors bring safety to some, but are often fearsome figures in their work. At their best, they protect their communities from corrupting influences of cults, undead, and creatures from the outer planes. At their worst, they are tyrants, leading reigns of terror to quash dissent and oppress those who do not share their faiths.

Inquisitors exist throughout the multiverse, serving causes both good and evil. On many planes, the church of Lolth makes extensive use of them to root out dissent among the drow, and inquisitors of Bahamut are tasked with finding and quashing cults in service of Tiamat. In Faerun, Helm’s eternal quest to protect his servants draws many inquisitors, and the efforts of Bane’s followers to establish dominion over regions they control encourages many onto the path of the inquisitor. In Eberron, Thrane’s Church of the Silver Flame and the secret police of Zilargo include many inquisitors among their ranks. Inquisitors abound among the clerics of Ravenloft, given the predominance of malign entities to be fought, corrupt cults to be stopped, and overbearing tyrants to be served.
#### **Seership Domain**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
Seers are those touched by gods or other powerful entities in order to help guide others. Rather than being the one to smite those who their patron considers “evil” or “unjust”,

Seers help influence events and people in order to gain a favored outcome. While altering Fate is incredibly beneficial, it sometimes comes at a price. The eyes of a Seer can view the threads of magic that weave between creatures and places. They are often wise beyond their intelligence as their patron nudges them forward like the guiding hands of fortune.
#### **Trade Domain**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
The Trade Domain focuses on the acquisition of wealth, the safeguarding of items and the negotiation of deals and bargains. In many civilizations, the power and influence of coin is said to rival that of the gods themselves. The gods of trade often promote the betterment of the self through financial success, as well as its benefits to society as a whole — though some are more focused on its more selfish applications. Clerics of this domain often travel as merchants, offering their divine services in each town they visit. Others take a more mercenary path, willing to venture into dangerous places for the right price.
#### **Community Domain**<sup>(HWD)</sup>
The community domain focuses on the ties that bind all people together. These are the ties of family and friendship, the ties to ancestors, as well as the ties between elders and the next generation with whom they share their wisdom. The power of the Gods of community is in the security of home and hearth, and the joy of good company. Many such gods teach the value of tradition and simple ways of living in harmony with the natural world. They also tend towards the rule of law, not as a kind of great bureaucracy, but as sacred traditions passed from generation to generation. Some gods advocate the removal of harsh or disruptive forces to this order, and proper sanctions for the violation of the goodwill that any community ought to provide. Clerics of such gods value unity, and praise the strength that can be gained when people support each other.
#### **Night Domain**<sup>(HWD)</sup>
The night is mysterious, and conceals many unseen dangers. However, the cover of darkness also brings protection from predators and shadows within which one can conceal themselves. The gods of night are varied, encompassing those who would use the cover of darkness to protect others from threats, to those who would use the shadows for wrong doings. The motives of night gods are often shrouded in mystery. Many teach their followers that it is only by peering through the darkness and looking beyond what is hidden that one can attain truth. Clerics of night do their best to keep themselves and their companions safe while journeying through the darkness.
#### **Commerce Domain**<sup>(FEQ)</sup>
Prayer may be the currency of the gods, but hard cash makes the world go round. Clerics of the Commerce Domain believe that society and economy are two sides of the same coin, and defending one’s community means little if you don’t have the resources and trade to back it up. As the Sovereign of World and Wealth, Kol Korran is the most common patron to Clerics of this domain, but those with a more selfish outlook might look to the Keeper to support their greed.
#### **Mirror Domain**<sup>(FCG)</sup>
The mirror domain is devoted to the ideals of truth and self-reflection. Those who follow this domain craft a magical mirror that deflects harm, reflects a healing light, and connects them to knowledge. While these mirrors begin as ordinary handheld objects, they are physically transformed as part of a sacred ritual connecting the follower to “the source,” the domain’s term for universal knowledge. Adherents believe that conducting this ritual in the Feywild produces the most powerful mirrors.

The mirrors are viewed as both fierce weapons and holy relics by followers of this domain. It is not uncommon for them to include the mirror in hallowed rites and ceremonies, especially those that involve scrying. They may also polish their mirrors regularly and adorn them with symbols, etchings, engravings, or other decorations. Upon death, adherents of the mirror domain often leave their mirrors to aspirants who take the mirror through the ritual anew.
#### **Mind Domain**<sup>(EE)</sup>
This path blends divine devotion and psychic power. The forces tied to the Mind domain teach followers that the mind is the greatest tool and the mightiest weapon in creation. A cleric of the Mind domain learns to harness their own mental power, then uses this gift to protect the faithful and smite enemies.

In Eberron, the Mind domain is most associated with the kalashtar Path of Light and the Riedran Path of Inspiration. However, followers of the cults of the Dragon Below might also follow this path. While visions of Xoriat can certainly drive a priest into madness, they might also reveal deeper secrets and mental powers.
#### **Cosmic Domain**<sup>(ECHH)</sup>
There are things better left unsaid and unseen, things that would break a man’s mind into pieces, that would turn even the most stalwart warrior into a whimpering, pitiful sight. You have glimpsed these truths, a gift, now held safely in your mind’s eye. Even the mightiest elven intellect couldn’t fathom the whole of that which you know to be out there, but you will grant them the opportunity to try.
#### **Vigilance Domain**<sup>(ECHH)</sup>
Your god holds back the tides of war, diverts the blades in the night, and diffuses the plots of many. To the best of your abilities and in service to their ideals, you aid them, selflessly and tirelessly, holding vigil wherever and whenever needed. At some time an attack will come and the fate of the many will hang on the discipline of the few, or the one. It will be you that makes the difference in that hour, and you will be ready, as always.
#### **Missionary Domain**<sup>(CCS)</sup>
Clerics of the Missionary Domain operate within a variety of different orders under a diverse set of deities, but they all have been granted the same purpose—spread the word of their god. For some this mission is a virtuous act, and for others, it is simply one side of their deal for divine power.
#### **Mystery Cult Domain**<sup>(KT)</sup>
While most clerics follow defined gods who seek to convert others to the cause, those of the Mystery Cults often intentionally obscure their faith with esoteric references and cloaked intentions. No less devoted than their more classically divine peers, they are not merely warlocks, but people of true faith in their dark and unknown deities.

Standing at the blasphemous confluence of divine and psionic power, they are almost universally condemned and feared, often shrouding their nature and abilities with mystery and working toward esoteric goals.
#### **Judgement Domain**<sup>(KT)</sup>
A Judgment Domain cleric is a cleric who oversees the distribution of law and order. They may do so in the name justice itself, or in service to a particular aspect of justice. This might be a lawful god—perhaps compassionate, but they may equally be harsh for those that dispense the iron fist of tyranny the world might need—or at the behest of an institution of justice in the land.

Employing a Justice Domain cleric is something that any ruling power must consider carefully. While they are almost always Lawful to the extreme, they answer only to their own, higher, ideals of justice.
#### **Martyr Domain**<sup>(KT)</sup>
Followers of gods that believe in taking on the suffering of those around them. Stalwart and unflinching, these intrepid souls seek to ease the suffering of those around them. While typically altruistic, sometimes their motivations are further afield, belonging to strange cults of suffering or acceptance.
#### **Void Domain**<sup>(KT)</sup>
Clerics of the Void Domain draw their power from the emptiness between stars, the dark corners of the universe where light dares not venture. These clerics are masters of the unseen and the unfathomable, wielding the very essence of nothingness to warp reality. They can vanish into nothingness, reappearing elsewhere in an instant, and conjure voids that consume light and hope. As emissaries of the void, they channel the terrifying, awe-inspiring power of the infinite darkness, turning the very absence of existence into a formidable weapon. Their presence is a chilling reminder that not all power comes from the light; some lies hidden in the darkness, waiting to be harnessed.

#### **Dream Domain**<sup>(KT)</sup>
Clerics of the Dream Domain draw upon the power of the ethereal realm of dreams, using their connection to this mystical place to heal allies, control enemies, and shape the dreams of those around them.

They follow gods of dreams, creativity, art, music, and the moon.
#### **Entropy Domain**<sup>(XLNEE)</sup>
Heretics preach of a void at the center of the universe that dying gods created to devour the Weave. The necrotic energy it emits is called “Entropy”: a potent force that clerics can harness to shield themselves from magic and annihilate arcane casters. The chained god Tharizdun claims this domain, while in Chessenta, a giant sphere of annihilation is worshipped as an aspect of Entropy itself. Cultists who wield the power go by many names: thaumatoclasts, entropomancers, or entropists.
#### **Survival Domain**<sup>(XLNEE)</sup>
Clerics and shamans of primitive tribes living in harsh environments have no greater mission than ensuring the survival of their tribes. The gods of survival often have other domains in similar realms, such as life or nature. The worshippers who work within the Survival domain, however, are much more primal and brutal than their counterparts.
### Level Up: Advanced 5e
#### **Healer Domain**

#### **Oracle Domain**

#### **Sun Priest Domain**

#### **Warpriest Domain**

#### **Evolution Domain**<sup>(BoE)</sup>
There are few gods of the Evolution Domain; indeed, many gods oppose it outright. But the march of nature and the pressure of survival never ebbs, and so evolution continues with or without the gods’ blessing.

Whether or not the first beasts were divinely constructed, those that live in the world today adapt to their environment over generations; those that fail to do so go extinct. In this way, evolution is an arbiter of living things, and an unspoken ethic of the multiverse: adapt or die. Clerics that understand the profundity of this system revere the Evolution Domain and carry its teachings far and wide.
#### **Hunt Domain**<sup>(HGMH)</sup>
From Artemis to Diana, Skadi and Woden - all gods of the hunt relish the chase. They promote the ideals of a journey: finding a quarry, learning its’ habits, and finishing it with a swift, precise blow. Clerics of these gods might bless nobles before a hunt, work as mercenaries tracking dangerous monsters through the wilderness, or be employed as scouts within armies. They are adept at finding their prey and, once located, use their magic to ensure they are never outrun. Such priests teach that all useful materials must be harvested and consumed to properly honor a quarry, and to ensure the gods’ blessing during the next foray into the wilds.
#### **Festivity Domain**<sup>(LAL)</sup>
Worshipping deities like Dionysus, Bacchus, Sucellus, and Inari, clerics of the Festivity domain spread joy and frivolity wherever they roam. If not kept in check, the most insignificant gathering can spin out of control to become a roiling crowd of jubilation as the cleric miraculously finds food and drink with which to incite a celebration.

Indeed, tales abound of clerics of Festivity infiltrating fortified citadels under siege, instigating exuberant carousing, and leaving their fellow merrymakers collapsed and exhausted after expending every last iota of energy. It is then a simple task for a waiting army to enter the city and lock their fatigued foes in chains. As the ancient proverb goes, “there is no celebration comparable to a cleric’s celebration, for a cleric’s celebration does not cease”.
#### **Astral Domain**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
Gods of the Astral Plane are as lost to time and space as the realm they reign over. The Astral Plane fills the gaps between the planes of existence and is an important, balancing force in the cosmic ecosystem of the multiverse. Practitioners of this domain see the absence of anything as something, and consider the Astral Plane as the ultimate destination of all things. These acolytes follow the ultimate path to their destination, and help shepherd others along their way in a grand mission of entropy. Clerics of the astral domain are chaotic by nature, but typically choose to destroy evil where they find it and hasten its inevitable journey to the Astral Plane.
#### **Festus Domain**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
Gods of eating and drinking, such as Daghdha or Dionysus, promote the value of a good meal as much as they do the joy of sharing it with friends. As a follower of this domain, you believe that a good feast can be enough to settle most wars. You may know this first-hand: perhaps your life has been marred by poverty and survival with spoiled scraps, or maybe you’ve been blessed with lovingly-cooked meals and the joy of a full stomach. Regardless of your origins, you recognize the magic of a good meal and the power it has on a person’s spirit and well-being.

Through your passion and devotion, you see mealtime as a joyous way to worship the magic of food and your chosen deity. You are a capable chef with an appreciation of all food, both good and bad. You know that a foul meal can turn even the most veteran of stomachs against themselves, and have learned to harness this power for yourself. Like food, most people will like you at your best, but everyone will fear you at your worst.
#### **Blood Domain**<sup>TDR</sup>
Developed by the Claret Orders, the Blood Domain centers around the understanding of the natural life force as it exists within the body, and the divine conduit it can become. Those who take up this domain understand that the power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit’s anchor within the mortal shell.

Gods who grant the power of the Blood Domain, including the Ruiner and the Matron of Ravens, direct their followers to tap into the connection between body and soul, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one’s own vitality, and corrupt the bodies of others through the secret rites of hemocraft. Clerics of good gods use hemocraft to fill their self-sacrifice with purpose and power, while clerics with fewer morals use the blood of others to achieve their own malevolent ends.
#### **Moon Domain**<sup>TDR</sup>
Since the Founding, all mortal creatures have looked to the skies and sensed the power and mystery carried by Catha and Ruidus, the two moons of Exandria. The Moonweaver herself is said to guide her worshipers from within the pale glow of Catha, revealing hidden paths and granting inspired dreams to those who pray to that moon. Distant, dark Ruidus is often regarded with awe and apprehension, considered a portent for fell deeds and bad luck.
#### **Commerce Domain**<sup>UAH</sup>
The Commerce domain values trade, proper management of resources, and entrepreneurship above al else, believing a healthy economy is the best path to create a more perfect world. Gods of commerce and trade — including Gong, Kol Korran, and Waukeen — promote enterprise and the development of marketable crafts and skills.

Some clerics of this domain, however, eschew the worship of gods to instead focus their faith on the almighty coin, believing that wealth is the best resource for enacting lasting change and living long, happy, and healthy lives. 

#### **Darkness Domain**<sup>UAH</sup>
Gods of darkness and shadow, such as Set, Shar and the Raven Queen, are not often depicted din the best light, being associated with terror, desolation and the unending night. Dwelling in their gloomy, often lightless realms, these deities don’t tend to attract many followers. So when a cleric chooses to devote their life to the service of one of these gods, they are imbued with great power over the shadows, becoming able to cause fear in the hearts of mortals. These gods teach their followers to think like the forces of evil in order to slay and conquer them, countering dark powers with their own black gifts.

While some clerics of the Darkness Domain are evil fearmongers, most instead make it their mission to rehabilitate the image of their deity through acts of heroism using their shadowy powers, becoming dark champions that bring comfort to innocents in the darkest of nights. 

#### **Infernal Domain**<sup>UAH</sup>
The Infernal Domain, as the name suggests, stems from the very depths of the Nine Hells. Cultists have always flocked to Asmodeus and archdevils, siphoning away their power with fervent faith or the promises of countless souls. The constant for any cleric of the Infernal Domain is that everything has a cost, m and they are equipped to tempt you towards paying any cost no matter how dear. 

Not all clerics who walk this infernal path are evil. Some actively seek out wrong-doers and ensure their swift delivery to the Nine Hells, though others are driven solely by their self-interest. Regardless of their moral position, these clerics are typically lawful individuals, modeling their methodology on the strict law approach the Nine Hells is so infamous for. 
#### **Love Domain**<sup>UAH</sup>
Gods of love represent the concept in all its varied forms; altruism, family, fertility, passion and romance. Some gods, such as Chauntea, Eldath and Dionysus place an emphasis on one of these facets over others. Other gods, including Lliira, Sune and Aphrodite, give all of these concepts equal importance. Followers of these gods serve as matchmakers and midwives for their communities. Some are called to serve as diplomats or peacekeepers, believing that love really can conquer all. It is rare for the clergy of gods of love to take vows of celibacy as part of their initiation.
#### **Prophecy Domain**<sup>UAH</sup>
Clerics of the prophecy domain may worship any god or no god at all. Their oracular burden isn’t tied to the portfolio of a specific deity, Instead their faith in the divine order of the universe manifests as prophetic vision. This blessing is intertwined with a curse. All oracles and prophets labor under an affliction that debilitates them physically in some way even as it empowers them spiritually. 
#### **Time Domain**<sup>UAH</sup>
One of the central tenets of existence is the inexorable passage of time — the succession of past, present and future that guides and governs a mortal’s perception of life. To some, time is an enemy, one they have either conquered or been defeated by. To others, it is a comfort, a promise of new experiences or a distance from others. 

Gods of the Time domain may not experience time as mortals do, but they understand what its passage represents and the necessity of its continued flow. Clerics of these deities can manipulate the flow of time in minor ways, and have the responsibility to use these abilities to further the intention of their god, which often include ensuring time flows unhindered and that irresponsible beings do not seek to enforce their will on its passage. 
#### **Shadow Domain**<sup>(GTD)</sup>
Clerics of the Sacred Flame know that life is at all times a balance between the light and the dark. Most clerics uphold the flame, whose divine purpose is to hold back the darkness, and offer guidance to those who pass on. Clerics of the Shadow Do- main are in tune with the dark side of the divine. They stand to balance all things, practicing the powers of shadow against their enemies. They know that not all deserve the light, and so sending foul horrors to the shadows is their form of righteous justice.
## Craftsman
*Craftsmen are virtuoso artisans and genius inventors. Not content merely creating masterwork pieces of weapons and armor, they invent and engineer ingenious devices and singularly deadly weapons. Artisans of all types are an integral part of every culture: buildings must be erected, pots must be sent to the kiln, tools must be forged. Despite their pervasiveness, master craftsmen are still as rare as they are prized. These artisans, creators, and inventors can smith items of mythic quality, and can solve most any problem simply by using the right tool and the appropriate amount of force. (**Source: Valda’s Spire of Secrets**)*

*Adventuring craftsmen come in many varieties, but nearly all leverage their advanced knowledge of metallurgy, smelting, and construction to forge arms and armor rarely seen, even by other adventurers. The smiths test their schematics and designs themselves, building prototypes and experimental gear that can later be refined into mass-produced items.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Artisan’s Guilds</u>

*All master craftsmen learn the basics of smithing, leatherworking, woodworking, and other necessary disciplines on the path to mastery, either on their own or under the tutelage of another master artisan. However, as they hone their skills, m they invariably find themselves drawn to gatherings of other like-minded craftsmen. These groups, formalized as Guilds, provide a means to craftsmen to compare notes and schematics, acquire resources, and provide a means for craftsmen to ply their trade.*

### Valda’s Spire of Secrets
#### **Arcane Maesters’ Guild**
While most seasoned spellcasters will enchant a handful of magic items over the course of their careers, artisans belonging to the Guild of Arcane Maesters seek to become true masters of magic item creation. They rightly take seriously the forging of such powerful relics: each creation must be a masterwork in its own right to contain the potent magic woven into them. Despite laboring for months or even years to perfect their creations, seasoned maesters are always seen to be laden with dozens of magic items, attuned to a handful of rings, and carrying a wand of magic missiles, just in case.
#### **Armiger Guild**
The Armigers devote their skills to the art of armor smithing, with the firm belief that the right plate in the right place can make a warrior invincible.
#### **Bladeworker Guild**
Blade and bow, axe and mace: these are the tools with which the Bladeworkers try to change the world. They believe that the right blade, in the right hand can make a warrior unstoppable.
#### **Calibaron Guild**
The Calibarons know, better than most, that gunpowder is the single greatest invention ever created by mortals. A sword may let a skilled wielder lay a giant low and magic may let the savvy and the blessed stand up to the gods, but only a gun will let a common man put a dragon in its place.
#### **Forgeknight Guild**
To a Forgeknight, heat is not merely integral to forging, curing, and welding gear, it is a weapon in its own right, for the swing of a white-hot blade bites not only with steel, but with flame. A Forgeknight carries the intensity of a forge with them, storing it in their armor and building it up in their weapons, before unleashing it in a scorching blast.
#### **Mechanaut Guild**
For centuries, the pinnacle of mechanized vehicles was the apparatus of the crab, a singular device capable of exploring inhospitable environments, from the sea floor to lava-strewn volcanic fields. However, ambitious craftsmen from the Mechanauts' Guild have drawn up designs for a new vehicle, mightier and more customizable than the old apparatus. This device is a walking tank, equipped with savage fists, scuttling legs, and climate control enhancements—a vehicle to dwarf all others, a true feat of engineering.
#### **Thunderlord Guild**
From the earliest days of life, storms (and particularly lightning) have struck the creatures caught in them with awe and terror. The Thunderlords, by contrast, draw wild inspiration from the majesty of nature, and seek to, quite literally, capture lightning in a bottle.
#### **Trapper Guild**
Craftsmen are no strangers to turrets, bombs, and clockwork mechanisms, but the craftsmen of the Trappers' Guild raise this to a level of artistry. Given enough time and resources, a trapsmith can veritably blanket a room in dangerous implements, setting the stage to slay an intruder in a half-dozen unique ways. While the traps do the dirty work, the trapsmith is free to lounge about some distance away, enjoying a cold beverage and dreaming up new, dangerous designs.
## Dracoknight
*Dracoknights are a people who created a magical bond with a dragon companion at the moment of its hatching, becoming lifelong companions. The incredible power a dragon possesses can be harnessed in many ways by these individuals for spectacular effects. But despite any tough odds, a dracoknight always knows she is not alone. **(Source: DM’s Guild)***

*It is a magical connection that enhances both dracoknight and dragon. The dracoknight gains physiological traits associated with dragons, like the growth of scales, or occasionally belching motes of his dragon’s elemental breath. The dragon gains a greater sense of empathy, and grows to a far less solitary life than its reptilian brethren. The bond also creates a willpower, and often stubbornness, that far surpasses the sum of its parts.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Draconic Bonds</u>

*Dracoknights’ connections with their dragon companions are sacred. Dracoknights are there at their companion’s hatching, and stay with them for the remainder of their shared lifespan. They live together, fight together, and die together. When your dragon companion enters its adolescence, it becomes cognizant of itself in the context of the greater world, allowing you to forge a deeper connection and set you on the path to your mutual destiny. Your choice of Draconic Bond represents your partnership with your dragon companion. How will the two of you live, fight, and die together?*
#### **Guardian Bond**
Dracoguardians and their dragon companions enjoy working with a team, protecting their allies at all costs. They learn to take hits and respond in kind, fostering in their dragon companion the ideals of friendship and family.
#### **Rider Bond**
Dracoriders and their dragon companions love the thrill of speed, bypassing foes with swift attacks. They push the boundaries, and are considered by many to be reckless adrenaline-seekers. To rider and draconic mount, though, speed is the quintessence of freedom.
#### **Sniper Bond**
Dracosnipers and their dragon companions take joy in hunting, the dragon stirring the prey while the sniper brings it down. Most can recognize a dracosniper right away by their noticeably reptilian eyes, eyes that can read the most minute of details at a distance. To the sniper and dragon, though, the thrill of the hunt is only lesser to the thrill of a well-executed plan, and take pleasure in knowing the two are best intertwined.
#### **Mage Bond**
Dracomages and their dragon companions exult in the manipulation of elemental power, and are thrilled to discover that such energy can be transferred through the bond for the mage’s use. They know that their connection fuels this magic, and so seek to deepen their bond as much as possible, often leading to two different creatures of the exact same personality and mannerisms. Neither mage nor dragon, though, is ever happier than when manipulating storms of elemental energy in the heat of combat.
## Dragon Knight
*Dragon knights, a champion who fights alongside a dragon companion. Tough, relentless, and unyielding, knights and their dragons never give up, fighting to either heroic or devious ends. The bond between a knight and their dragon is nearly impossible to eclipse. Only powerful magic can even attempt to turn them against one another, and they nearly never fight each other against their own will. Despite this, a knight and their dragon are known to argue over strategy, tactics, or even miscellaneous things, as the dragon, despite its respect for its knight, is not quick to let go of its ego.(**Source: GM Binder**)*

*As the knight and dragon grow together, this bond strengthens, granting both the knight and dragon impressive strength and unique powers. The dragon is typically the stronger of the pair as they develop, but will be weaker earlier on, while the knight still has to watch over them to ensure their bond can continue to flourish. Eventually, some knights might put down their weapons and live a simple life with their dragon, having forged a legendary friendship through the trials they faced.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Knight Practices</u>

*All dragon knights are divided by their practice, and much like the dragons they raise and fight with, the knights are known to be proud at their best, and egotistical at their worst. Two people of different practices are rarely able to get along, despite how similar they might be. Those of the Platinum Practice always regard themselves superior to those of the Shadow Practice, and members of the Elemental Practice consider the members of the Rider Practice to be brutish and dim-witted.*

*Despite these rivalries, dragon knights are fiercely loyal, and will never betray another dragon knight, even if they come from a different practice. Dragon knights believe they only have each other to count on, as no one else understands the intense bond between the knight and the dragon.*

**(2024e)**
#### **Bound Practice**
The dragon knights who adopt the bound practice seek to deepen the connection between themselves and their dragon, heightening their own mortal form as they adopt distinct draconic traits that they unleash in the heat of battle. 
#### **Devout Practice**
Dragon knights who follow the Devout Practice hold dragons in high esteem, especially the gods Bahamut and Tiamat. They treat all dragons they meet with reverence, even treating hostile dragons with respect during battle. 
#### **Valiant Practice**
Those of the Valiant Practice strive to lead their allies in battle. By wielding magical banners in battle, they inspire valor and hope in their allies. These dragon knights are able to defend their allies with their presence, turning the tide of any fight.

**(2014e v9)**
#### **Rider Practice**
The bond between a dragon knight and their dragon is strong, but those of the Rider Practice take that even further. They seek to live and to die beside their dragon, a sentiment shared by the dragon itself. While not all riders mount their dragons, those who don't are rare. Those of the Rider Practice fight in tandem with their dragon, and win in tandem with them.
#### **Elemental Practice**
Dragon knights of the Elemental Practice value the raw, destructive power of their dragons, as well as their inherent charisma, and strive to both emulate and empower this aspect of their dragons through magic.
#### **Platinum Practice**
A few dragon knights worship the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut. These few are members of the Platinum Practice, and are dedicated to preserving the lives of their allies and the innocent.
#### **Shadow Practice**
Dragon knights who revere dark magic, or even strive to cause suffering in others, make up members of the Shadow Practice. Dark and elusive, these dragon knights use misdirection and guile to gain the upper hand in battle.
#### **Garden Practice**
Some dragons wage war, and others hoard treasure. Few, however, learn to cultivate and nurture the earth, becoming one with it. Dragon knights of the Garden Practice live simple lives with their dragons, and only heed the call of adventure if something precious to them is at stake.
## Druid
*Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.*

*Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals — the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.*

*Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomitable will.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Druid Circles</u>

*Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.*

*At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.*
#### **Circle of the Land**
The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.
#### **Circle of the Moon** 
Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.

Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid’s blood.
#### **Circle of Dreams**
Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druids’ guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.
#### **Circle of the Shepherd**
Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds.
#### **Circle of Spores**
Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn’t the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. They see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.
#### **Circle of Stars**
The Circle of Stars allows druids to draw on the power of starlight. These druids have tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By revealing and understanding these secrets, the Circle of the Stars seeks to harness the powers of the cosmos.

Many druids of this circle keep records of the constellations and the stars’ effects on the world. Some groups document these observations at megalithic sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore. These repositories might take the form of stone circles, pyramids, petroglyphs, and underground temples—any construction durable enough to protect the circle’s sacred knowledge even against a great cataclysm.
#### **Circle of Wildfire**
Druids within the Circle of Wildfire understand that destruction is sometimes the precursor of creation, such as when a forest fire promotes later growth. These druids bond with a primal spirit that harbors both destructive and creative power, allowing the druids to create controlled flames that burn away one thing but give life to another.
#### **Circle of the City**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
The city lives; it has a pulse. It’s skin is of walls and towering stone structures, it’s breath of chimneys and rivers. While the city exists, it lives in harmony with it’s people, a delicate balance mediated by the urban druids. 

These urban druids belong to the Circle of the City and are a direct antithesis to the conventional idea of a druid; whereas a normal druid lives among majestic forests or breathtaking mountains and dresses in the greenery of the forest, an urban druid wears unassuming clothes and wanders the back alleys of a well-trodden city. But their powers are not to be underestimated. Druids of this circle can channel their natural powers to twist the streets into knots, uproot towers, and animate the cobblestones. Their charge might be unorthodox, but their authority over the cityscape matches any other druid’s power over the forest. 
#### **Circle of the Deep**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
The druids that maintain and protect the land are deluded to think that they keep dominion over the natural world, for they stand guard over only a small fraction of it; far greater, and far wilder, is the deep. Druids of the Deep are fewer in number, but greater in task, vowing to stand guard over the world’s oceans, seas, lakes and rivers. Safeguarding their inhabitants from the fools that walk the surface. 

The crushing depths have hardened these druids, and taught them to battle with every weapon underneath the waves. After all, the ocean is an unforgiving place; you can’t survive by just talking to fish. 
#### **Circle of the Fist**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
The defenders of the forests and champions of the trees, druids who join this circle take their charge as natural protectors seriously. Traditionally, all druid circles strive to protect the natural realm and maintain the world’s balance, but only druids of this circle guard the woodlands with the vigilance and fervor of a territorial beast. Fists of the Forest, as they are called, stave off intruders to their realms with flurries of bare-fisted strikes, empowered by the natural world, before disappearing into the treetops. At the height of their expertise, these druids fight more like beast of the forests than men, and are twice as deadly. 
#### **Circle of Stones**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
Age-old monuments crafted in forgotten times attest to a simple truth: there is power in the stones. Druids who join the ancient Circle of Stones carry on the tradition of raising stonehenges in places of great power, where leylines intersect and magic strengthens. Such locations are marked as nexuses of power, where the Forgotten Laws of the Old Gods are still heeded — but such things are known only to a few druids today. Others merely see the looming stone monuments as enigmatic circles, grim reminders of the enormity of time. 
#### **Circle of Vermin**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of Vermin, sometimes known as Vermin Lords, find their source of power in the lowliest of creatures: insects, rats, spiders and other pests or vermin. Unmistakably, your coming is signaled by the scrambling of little claws and the cawing of the crows. You hold legions of these creatures at your command, ready to swarm, bite, and claw, and you can become one of them, top walk among your innumerable children. 
#### **Circle of the Wyrm**<sup>(VSS)</sup>
Druids who join the Circle of the Wyrm hold dragons in higher esteem than all other works of creation. These druids believe, as many dragons do, that wyrms are perfect creatures: the pinnacle of all life brought into existence by the antediluvian gods. Likewise, these druids aspire to perfect wyrmhood, and gradually become like dragonkind. 
#### **Circle of Twilight**<sup>(UA)</sup>
The [[Circle of Twilight]] seeks to exterminate undead creatures and preserve the natural cycle of life and death that rules over the cosmos. Their magic allows them to manipulate the boundary between life and death, sending their foes to their final rest while keeping their allies from that fate.

These druids seek out lands that have been tainted by undeath. Such places are grim and foreboding. Once vibrant forests become gloomy, haunted places devoid of animals and filled with plants dying a slow, lingering death. The Circle of Twilight goes to such places to banish undeath and restore life.
#### ~~**Circle of the Seedling**<sup>(UA)</sup>~~

#### **Circle of Ash**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of Ash believe in the power of rebirth and resurrection, both physical and spiritual. The ash they take as their namesake is the result of burning and death, but it can fertilize the soil and help bring forth new life. For these druids, ash is the ultimate symbol of the elegant cycle of life and death that is the foundation of the natural world. Some such druids even use fresh ash to clean themselves, and the residue is often kept visible on their faces.

Druids of this circle often use the phoenix as their symbol, an elemental creature that dies and is reborn from its own ashes. These druids aspire to the same purity and believe resurrection is possible if they are faithful to their beliefs. Others of this circle are drawn to volcanos and find volcanic eruptions and their resulting ash clouds to be auspicious events.
#### **Circle of Bees**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of Bees are friends to all stinging insects but focus their attention on honeybees and other pollinating insects. When not adventuring, they tend hives, either created by the insects or by themselves. They tap into the horror inherent in stinging insects to protect their allies or the fields hosting their bee friends.
#### **Circle of Crystals**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Circle of Crystals druids first arose in subterranean environments, where they helped tend giant crystal gardens, but now they can be found most anywhere with access to underground caverns or geothermal activity. These druids view crystals as a naturally occurring form of order and perfection, and they value the crystals’ slow growth cycle, as it reminds them the natural world moves gradually but eternally. This teaches young druids patience and assures elder druids their legacy will be carried on in each spire of crystal. As druids of this circle tend their crystals, they learn how to use the harmonic frequencies of different crystals to create a variety of effects, including storing magic.
#### **Circle of Sand**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
The Circle of Sand originally arose among the desert dunes, where druids forged an intimate connection with the sands that surrounded them. Now such circles gather anywhere with excess sand, including coastlines or badlands. 

While the unacquainted might view sand as lifeless and desolate, druids of this circle know the truth—there is life within the sand, as there is almost anywhere. These druids have witnessed the destructive power of sand and the sandstorm and know to fear and respect them. Underestimating the power of sand is only for the foolish.
#### **Circle of The Green**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of the Green devote themselves to the plants and green things of the world, recognizing the role of plants in giving life. By continued communion with plant life, they believe they draw nearer to what they call “The Green,” a cosmic thread that binds all plant life. Druids of this circle believe they gain their abilities by tapping into the Green, and they use this connection to summon a spirit from it.
#### **Circle of The Shapeless**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of the Shapeless believe that oozes, puddings, and jellies serve an important and integral role in the natural world, particularly in decomposition and in clearing detritus. Druids of this circle also admire the adaptability of these gelatinous creatures and study them to learn how to duplicate some of their abilities. 

The sworn enemies of Circle of the Shapeless druids are the so-called ooze lords and their servants who pervert the natural order by controlling and weaponizing such creatures.
#### **Circle of Wind**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Founded in deserts, badlands, and grasslands, where wind dominates and controls the landscape, the teachings of the Circle of Wind have spread far and wide, like a mighty storm. Druids who follow this circle’s teachings embrace the mercurial winds to create several effects.
#### **Circle of Bough**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
There are druids who seek to bond not with beasts, but with the timeless sentinels that blanket the land: the ancient, gnarled trees whose wisdom is beyond compare. These druids—druids of the Bough—learn to shapeshift into the very trees that they revere.
#### **Circle of the Coven**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
Druids are known amongst the masses for their secret groups, sacred locales, and sacramental rites. None fit this description more so than the druids that gather together in the spirit of cult sorority, where the whole is exponentially more powerful than the mere sum of its parts - which parts often consist of hags and other unseelie fey. These mystical magicians, while not known for infant-snatching like their namesake, do give more attention to the civilized world than the rest of their kind. Their skill with the cauldron, and their ability to take the form of humanoids in addition to beasts, allow them to closely observe and even infiltrate communities of all kinds. While the intentions of these druids are frequently debated amongst those who are familiar with them, their power is not.
#### **Circle of the Dragonfriend**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
Dragons are powerful magical beings that shape the environment around them and their lairs. A few brave druids work with these creatures and tend to those environments. Such druids often pick up tips, tricks, and magical traits from their companions. These druids are known as dragonfriends. 

It is rare to find a dragonfriend trying to dominate a dragon, or that condescends to be ruled by one. While dragonfriends usually maintain a realistic understanding that dragons’ powers are much greater than their own, they maintain peaceful coexistence and peership with dragons. Those who live near evil dragons often make arrangements for tenuous, indefinite alliances.
#### **Circle of Seafarers**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
You follow an old tradition of sea-dwelling druids that protect the waters from creatures, and creatures from the waters. Your culture has developed unique fighting styles not found in other druidic sects, which make you excellent combatants in and around the seas.
#### **Circle of the Leaf**<sup>(ToV)</sup>
Druids who align with the ring of the Leaf feel a deep connection to plants. Leaf druids are drawn to the quiet, natural spaces of the world. They find great peace and wisdom among hidden groves, ancient forests, and overgrown gardens left to flourish without the influence of civilization. To you, nothing is more important than nurturing the flora that makes all life possible.
#### **[[Circle of Visions]]**<sup>(FCG)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of Visions have been trained to use the mind’s eye to see what others cannot. Through intense meditation in the Feywild or training in harsh environments on the Material Plane, these druids have expanded their senses to extremes. Their familiarity with the future can be surprising as is their knowledge of the planes. These druids use their sight to preserve life and protect it from the unseen dangers that lurk beyond the veil. 

As a Circle of Visions druid, your eyes are permanently changed in some way to reflect your ability to see beyond mortal sight. Consult the Eye Appearances table and either roll for an option or choose an appearance yourself. These appearances do not affect your ability to see normally, and you can still be affected by the blinded condition.
#### **Circle of the Forged**<sup>(EE)</sup>
What is truly natural? The warforged are living creatures, despite being constructed from wood and steel. Druids who embrace the Circle of the Forged explore the potential of the warforged form, blending animal shapes with warforged durability. This is a young path, pioneered by a handful of warforged who sought a greater understanding of their role in the world. Over the last few decades, a number of warforged have embraced the Circle of the Forged; however, it isn’t limited to warforged; a Cannith heir or an aspiring artificer might pursue primal power as a way to transcend the limited flesh they were born with.
#### **Circle of Blossoming**<sup>(ECHH)</sup>
The vines, they grew at lightning speed, up from the ground they came. They intertwined to form the legs, the back, the maw, the mane. Then lilies sprouted from the joints, its hide was daisy swept. And when at last the growth had stopped, a flowered beast was left. The druid then did raise their voice, in sylvan words it spoke. Its eyes, they filled with greenish light; the verdant creature woke.
#### **Circle of Primeval Grove**<sup>(ECHH)</sup>
The ancient forests of the world lie in restless slumber. Humble servants of the Old Way, the Circle of the Primeval Grove are conduits for the vengeful wilds, full of thorn and moss, and of gnarled roots clawing their way across the ground, twisted with malice and old enough to recall every cruelty imposed upon them over the millennia.
#### **Circle of Crystals**<sup>(CCS)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of Crystals have a deep connection to arcane crystals, which are magically infused crystals discovered in the early settlement of Prismatic Falls. To these druids, naturally occurring sources of such crystals are sacred, and they believe that they harbor the closest and deepest connection to the intrinsic magic of the world.
#### **Circle of Nightmares**<sup>(KT)</sup>
Druids are often thought of as the guardians of the natural order and having a deep connection to the creatures of the land. Sometimes that connection goes horribly wrong. A druid of this circle has found their mind entangled with the horrors of the beyond, their natural connection to nature and its beasts becoming warped by the dark dreams. 

Druids of this circle may be haunted by the terrors they see, but many simply find their minds inoculated against the horror (perhaps by the touch of madness). Some even treat twisted abominations with the same care other druids might take to vicious and wild animals, treating them with pragmatic understanding and empathy Sometimes their connection even seems to be mutual.
#### **Circle of Aspects**<sup>(KT)</sup>
A circle of the aspects druid, frequently called a spirit shifter, is a druid that has attuned themselves to the spiritual aspects of beasts. These druids tap into their fundamental nature, calling up certain aspects of wilderness and embodying them in spirit. A druid of this circle can be said to Wild Shape their soul, rather than their body. 

Druids of this circle must walk a fine line, as it can be easy for them to delve too deeply into the powerful and savage states of mind they enter. However, these magical aspects grant them both unique power and perspective as they walk the world, seeing the world through the eyes of the bestial spirits that boil within them.
#### **Circle of Elements**<sup>(KT)</sup>
The Circle of Elements allows druids to tap the purest of primal powers, unleashing devastating elemental powers destroy their enemies and reshape the battlefield. These druids are the wrath of nature incarnate, and leave a path that is burned, frozen, scorched, or broken through all that would defile. 

Anyone that makes the mistake of thinking that nature is serene beauty would do well remember why civilized creatures spend so much of their time trying to keep it at bay.
#### **Circle of Growth**<sup>(KT)</sup>
Druids within the Circle of Growth are among the most direct emissaries of nature, speaking for the forests and wilderness in order to bring its will to the rest of the world.. They can be kind and nurturing presences that seek to ease the suffering all living things, or militant wardens that seek to end the exploitation of natural resources.
#### **Circle of Roots**<sup>(KT)</sup>
While many druids have a kinship with the deep woods of nature, a Circle of Roots druid has a connection that can go much deeper, where some may wonder where the will of the primordial woods ends and the will of the druid starts. Legends say that the first of these druids were woads who took human form, rather than humans that took woad form, but such things are lost to legend. 

Frequently, regardless of the nature of their connection, these druids will feel most comfortable deep in nature, and place great value in its unspoiled form, sharing a world view more in common with dryads and treants than other mortals... perhaps they were even raised by such creatures, leading them to this path.
#### **Circle of the City**<sup>(KT)</sup>
The circle of the city is about adaption. The adaption of nature to cities, and the adaption of cities to nature. Druids of the circle see the teeming life of the city as just another ecosystem, one adapted to a special type of life, feeling kinship with the creatures that thrive in such an environment, particularly that which remains wild in the heart of the city, such as rats, pigeons, and cats. 

While more primeval druids may view them as scarcely different to other city-dwellers, they are no less in tune with nature that other druids, simply] tuning into a different, more subtle and pervasive, frequency
#### **Circle of the Sun**<sup>(KT)</sup>
Druids revere aspects aspects of nature, and none is more central the cycle of life than the sun, origin of light and life. Druids of this circle are not clerics of the god of the sun, but represent it's aspect in the cycle of life, the light and heat and it brings, the fiery radiance with which it reigns over the world.

Druids of the Circle often stand in opposition that with crawls through the dark, that which corrupts in the absence of light, and while still inclined to the neutrality many Druids uphold, they tend to swing further the extremes of passion and action, willing to burn away the rot. Though they might aim for a controlled burn, a controlled burn may often be more destructive than a simple pruning.
#### **Circle of The Wild**<sup>(KT)</sup>
For some druids, they have found their friends among the beasts of the wild, forming a close kinship with the furred and the fanged. They often roam the wilderness, placing little value on the trappings of civilization, more concerned with nature, hunting, and exploring. 

The longer they spend in the wild with their animal friends, the more their habits tend to intertwine with the beasts around them. Sometimes they will cook food for their animal friends, while other times they will take to eating their food raw. They play the role of a caretaker, warden, and advocate for the wild.
#### **Circle of Seasons**<sup>(XLNEE)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of Seasons learn early in their trials that all things are transient. All things that live must die, and those things that don't live are worn away by the wind and rain. 

As a druid of the seasons, you embody nature’s invisible hand. Whether through famine or pestilence, flood or fire, you revere the world’s natural cycle of destruction and rebirth. Your connection to the natural cycles of life and death allows you to burn nature’s enemies and renew her allies.
#### **Circle of the Spiritlord**<sup>(XLNEE)</sup>
Ages ago, nature priests with a greater connection to the spirit realm believed the world itself to be formed from a group of elemental and primordial spirits, each specifically charged to harness one of the major elements of creation. This band of tribal druids developed a set of ritual practices that allowed them to summon these spirits, whose essence now resides in every rock, tree, and breath of air, controlling the ebb and flow of nature not only in their homeland, but in all lands beyond. This order of priests were known as spiritlords. 

Spiritlords begin their journey with the rites handed down by those before them, specifically, the ritual to create a special mask from an ironwood tree. This mask allows the spiritlord to play host to the spirit-elementals roaming this world. As the spiritlord grows in power and gains a heightened level of attunement to the spirit world, their mask transforms along with them, being altered with new carvings, ritual paints, and brands that symbolize the bond between the druid and the spirits they carry within.
### Level Up: Advanced 5e
#### **Circle of the Guardian**

#### **Circle of the Skinchanger**

#### **Circle of the Treespeaker**

#### **Circle of Primal**<sup>(BoE)</sup>
The Primal Circle was the foremost druidic circle, dedicated to the caste of titanic creatures that once dominated the Material Plane. As their bestial companions were driven to the fringes of the map, the Primal Circle persisted, channeling the spirits of long- forgotten beasts, such as tyrannosaurs and saber- toothed tigers. These primal spirits begin as youths and grow into their colossal adulthood as the druid grows in power, culminating in a behemoth from prehistory, a beast unparalleled in size and ferocity.
#### **Circle of the Hive**<sup>(HGMH)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of the Hive share their body with a plethora of tiny arthropods—insects, arachnids, or even crustaceans. These symbiotes call such druids home, living within their skin, clothes, and hair. This habitation might manifest as a honeycomb-like hive, a silky subcutaneous trapdoor (below which lurks a spider), or butterfly chrysalids hanging from their hair. Druids of this circle relish creating a moving.

Druids of this circle relish creating a moving biosphere that sustains a variety of organisms, often seeking out new and exotic species as symbiotic lodgers. These creatures are a part of the druid, nourishing and protecting the druid as the druid nourishes and protects its tenants.
#### **Circle of the Unbroken**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
The Unbroken Circle is an order of druids who have abandoned the patient teachings of their predecessors, deciding instead to take up arms in defense of the wilderness. These combative druids form militias and harness the fury of nature itself to forcefully remove any encroaching evil that threatens their sacred lands. 

While the chaotic bend of nature is found within these druids, their bodies and impulses are tamed through training and discipline. Originally from the unforgiving Fester- wood, this circle’s teachings are as rigorous as the forest, blending a mixture of offense and defense to stand up to all of the world’s challenges.
#### **Circle of Dragons**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
The Circle of Dragons is an old order of druids steeped in rigid tradition. These honor-bound wardens of nature and draconic heritage are members of a secret society that have influenced governance, war, and culture across the world. High-standing members of this Circle have ties to royal bloodlines that date back generations, a connection that’s subtly showcased in royal family crests and insignia. 

Druids from this Circle know that dragons, and draconic magic, are as connected to the world as plants or beasts, and utilize that connection to transform into a unique and powerful draconic form all their own.
#### **Circle of Eclipse**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of the Eclipse are stewards of the celestial balance, and draw their power from the luminous bond shared by sun and moon. They find their strength waxing and waning with the ebb and flow of these celestial bodies, but it is during the rare moments of eclipse, when the world is briefly cloaked in celestial union, that they feel truly connected to the natural world and the cosmos above. Masters of both the brilliance of daylight and the mystique of darkness, druids of this circle embody the harmony of cosmic forces, wielding their celestial magic to protect the natural world and preserve the delicate equilibrium of day and night.
#### **Circle of the Grove**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of the Grove spend weeks alone in forest glades in silent meditation. They find peace and wisdom in the stillness of the woods, and in time learn how to become a part of them themselves. Ancient rings of trees are sometimes archdruids themselves, transformed into trees in endless meditation. Dryads and half-dryads that become practicing druids are often members of this Circle.
#### **Circle of the Storm**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
Druids of the Circle of the Storm revel in the roar of an unbridled thunderstorm, either finding kinship in its chaos or in the stillness found between them. These circle members tend to meet in open fields or on tower rooftops during storms, rather than in the quiet forest glens of other druidic circles. They feel the push and pull of positive and negative forces within nature, using it to transform into streaking bolts of devastating lightning.
#### **Circle of the Blighted**<sup>TDR</sup>
Those who channel the magic of life and nature often find themselves drawn to a particular shrine or natural site, binding their body and spirit to these places of power. Such druids draw vitality from their chosen location, protecting it with their lives—but not all succeed in defending these sacred realms. 

Whether through the subtle corruption of vile magics, the tainted presence of an ancient terror, or a terrible mistake unleashed by druids themselves, a land can become cursed with magic that warps any druid bound to that land. Twisted by their connection to an unhallowed territory, these guardians come to embody the defiled nature they serve, exalting the natural process of decay and using it to further their goals—or sometimes to seek a means to end the curse that plagues them.
#### **Circle of Bond**<sup>UAH</sup>
Ruids of the Circle of the Bond feel a greater connection to beasts than they do other sapient life. Many wish to eschew the complexities and complications of living within a society and interacting with hyumanoids for the quiet simpliciity offered by beasts, while others have experienced tragedy or betrayal at the hands of their peers, and seek comfort in an animal companion. Regardless of the reasons you joined this circle, you have formed a magical partnership with a beast, a deep bond that interlocks your minds and souls. 
#### **Circle of Branch**<sup>UAH</sup>
The Circle of the Branch is made up of sages and warriors who believe that the greatest wisdom is found in the stillness of plants, especially long-lived trees. Seeking to achieve a modicum o their groves’ enlightenment, these druids magically fuse bark from sacred trees into their flesh, assuming arboreal forms that they use to protect and learn from the ancient forests of the multiverse. Often referred to as barksleeves these defenders emphasize violence only in defense of self or of primordial grove, preferring the stillness of peace and mutual growth to the tragedy of cutting down something of great potential. 
#### **Circle of Cataclysm**<sup>UAH</sup>
Druids in the Circle of Cataclysm embody the most destructive manifestations of nature’s power. Channeling the untamed might of natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanoes, these spellcasters destroy their enemies with none of the subtlety typical of druids. Members of this circle see themselves as agents of the end times, heralds of ruination, and deliverers of nature’s judgment. 
#### **Circle of Community**<sup>UAH</sup>
Druids of this circle recognize communication and symbiotic relationships as the most powerful dforces in nature. Countless sapient species and monsters, each with their own tradition and culture, have achieved more than they might ever have through cooperation and community. It is this innate sense of togetherness that druids of this circle thrive on. A community is only as strong as its weakest link, and a Druid of Community makes it their goal to empower their companions to survive and thrive as one. 
#### **Circle of the Spirit**<sup>UAH</sup>
Druids of the Circle of the Spirit are the shamans and spirit-talkers of the Old Faith. While other druids turn their focus to the emulation of the natural world or beasts, shamans learn to commune with the spirits and ethereal beings that remain hidden from mortal senses. Not satisfied by merely peering into the invisible realm, shamans learn to call spirits from it, channeling their power and using it as their own. 
#### **Circle of Succulents**<sup>UAH</sup>
There is one goal for druids of the Circle of Succulents: survive. They don’t necessarily aim to defeat unnatural force sin the world, but rather to outlast them, as the toughest plants in nature commonly do. These druids typically hail from warmer climate, s where succulents are common. 
#### **Circle of Petal**<sup>(OTG)</sup>
In the tranquil groves where nature’s harmony sings loudest, there exists a circle of druids attuned to the delicate dance of petals upon the breeze. These druid guardians of the natural world, known as the Circle of the Petal, draw their power from the spirit of Obojima, the steady island breeze and the ephemeral beauty and resilience of flowers. Embracing these subtle powers, they harness the whispers of the wind and the gentle caress of petals to weave their enchantments and shape the world around them. 

Members of the Circle of the Petal are revered for their deep connection to the sacred dawn petal tree and their ability to evoke its serene splendor in both peaceful sanctuaries and in dire situations. These druids become conduits of life energy, channeling the essence of blossoms into healing balms, protective barriers, and devastating bursts of floral fury. Guided by the eternal cycle of growth, bloom, and decay, they embody the ever-renewing vitality of nature, ensuring that even in the darkest of times, hope blossoms anew like petals on the wind.
#### **Circle of Contamination**<sup>(GTD)</sup>
As druids are often in tune with nature and the natural order, most see delirium as a scourge upon the world. However, a rare few see the truth: the eldritch stones are an essential part of the natural order, one which works at a cosmic scale. Druids of the Circle of Contamination use the blighted rocks and contaminating Haze as a conduit for supernatural evolution. They have embraced the chaotic power of Delirium as an extension of the inherent chaos in the natural order, spreading the Haze while wielding it as a powerful ally to fuel their spells.
## Evolutionist
*Evolutionists are ambitious warriors; who rather than building their strength through practice and training, improve their natural talents by enhancing and upgrading their body. They reject the idea that they should play the hand they’re dealt, instead seeking to change the game. Where most accept the body they are given, evolutionists aim to control it and push it past its limits. Each evolutionist has different methods and motivations for upgrading their body, but they all are connected by one common goal: evolution. (**Source: Crystalpunk Campaign Setting**)*

*Evolutionists are defined by their yearning to improve their bodies through methods that go beyond mere training. They achieve this through a variety of means, from inventive technology and alchemy to ancient magics or even pacts with otherworldly beings. No matter the method, an evolutionist begins to change and alter their form by augmenting their body or growing completely new appendages. These upgrades allow evolutionists to overpower their enemies, either through raw enhanced capability or through unique tactics enabled by their non-standard biology. Evolutionists live a life of continual growth, utilizing the abilities they gain to seek methods to enhance their bodies even further.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Evolutionary Methods</u>

*An evolutionist’s method is fundamental to their being—it is the vital gateway that allows them to modify their body and the path which sets them apart from others of their kind. An evolutionist’s method is a defining factor in their appearance, the source of their power, and thorough representation of their identity. Without an evolutionary method, one would not be an evolutionist.*

#### **Method of Innovation**
You personally manufacture the form you desire, which consists of constructed enhancements and fabricated body parts. While most evolutionists of this method enhance themselves with intricate, magical technology, some prefer to instead use earthen, elemental augmentations or stitched pieces of monsters. Regardless, evolutionists of this method are resilient and innovative. They constantly tinker, repair, and fine tune themselves, continually  building towards something greater.
#### **Method of Mutation**
Your body is greatly mutated: flesh morphed, resized,  and reconfigured. Parts grown, and possibly changed  in color. These mutations could be included through a vile practice of alchemy, a powerful curse, or a symbiotic relationship with a parasitic creature. No matter the method, these evolutionists live on the edge—constantly pushing their body to its limit. When they modify themselves, their bodies undergo chaotic, potent transformations that push the boundaries of their psyche.
#### **Method of Infusion**
Your form is intensely magical—infused within you is the power of pure arcana. You weave this power to shape magical, iridescent enhancements— translucent limbs, lustrous, glowing eyes, or even tattoo-like augmentations that wrap around your body. You could have received this power at birth, or it might have been imbued within you at some point in your life. Perhaps a higher being granted you such power. No matter its origin, its your process that allows for your enhancements—as you weave your body in the same way that a mage weaves their spells.
## Fighter
*Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.*

*Not everyone who can tell you which end of a sword to hold is a fighter: that title is reserved for the trained guards, valiant knights, and masterful veterans of the world, and apart from their shared expertise with weapons, armor, and combat, few two fighters are exactly the same. Fighters are focused on the honing of their skill in combat, adapting to the settings around them and developing new solutions to the challenges they face. Some choose to focus on the mastery of one particular weapon or develop keen tactical skill, whereas others rely on clever magical forces to enhance their martial prowess. Beyond that, weapon and armor preference play a significant part in determining a fighter’s role. When you are a fighter, you’re equipped to face the world’s dangers head-on.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Martial Archetypes</u>

*Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings — as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face. Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.*
#### **Champion**
The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.
#### **Battle Master**
Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.
#### **Eldritch Knight**
The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.
#### **Arcane Archer**
An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.
#### **Cavalier**
The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.
#### **Samurai**
The Samurai is a fighter who draws on an implacable fighting spirit to overcome enemies. A Samurai’s resolve is nearly unbreakable, and the enemies in a Samurai’s path have two choices: yield or die fighting.
#### **Psi Warrior**
Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior is a fighter who augments their physical might with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, and barriers of mental force. Many githyanki train to become such warriors, as do some of the most disciplined high elves. In the world of Eberron, many young kalashtar dream of becoming Psi Warriors.

As a Psi Warrior, you might have honed your psionic abilities through solo discipline, unlocked it under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an academy dedicated to wielding the mind’s power as both weapon and shield.
#### **Rune Knight**
Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes, an ancient practice that originated with giants. Rune cutters can be found among any family of giants, and you likely learned your methods first or second hand from such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the giant’s work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you studied the giant’s craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower your equipment.
#### **Echo Knight**
A mysterious and feared frontline warrior of the Kryn Dynasty, the Echo Knight has mastered the art of using dunamis to summon the fading shades of unrealized timelines to aid them in battle. Surrounded by echoes of their own might, they charge into the fray as a cycling swarm of shadows and strikes.
#### **Purple Dragon Knight**
Purple Dragon knights are warriors who hail from the kingdom of Cormyr. Pledged to protect the crown, they take the fight against evil beyond their kingdom’s borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and fidelity to the code of chivalry to guide them in defeating evildoers.

A Purple Dragon knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.

#### **Buccaneer**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Honing their martial skills in fierce ship-to-ship combat, buccaneers become skilled in both gun and blade, able to lay out opponents with savage shots, while resisting the worst that can be thrown at them.
#### **Chaplain**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
Militaries and mercenary companies often contain members of various clergies among their ranks. These chaplains typically come from religious sects whose tenets promote war, healing, peace, protection, or freedom, and they tend to the emotional and physical well-being of their charges. In the eyes of your companions, you are as much a counselor and spiritual leader as you are a fellow warrior.
#### **Legionary**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
A legionary follows the techniques of close-quarters combat developed by soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder with their allies. This style of fighting spread far and wide, finding an honored place among the armies and mercenary companies of other races. True legionaries scoff at the image of the storybook hero standing alone against impossible odds, knowing together they can face any danger and emerge victorious.
#### ~~**Pugilist**<sup>(TOH)</sup>~~
~~Pugilists live by their fists, bare-knuckle warriors~~
~~who do not hesitate to throw hands if the situation~~
~~demands it. They know the intense, close, violent~~
~~intimacy of melee, and they operate unapologetically~~
~~in that space. Whether in fighting pits by the docks~~
~~to make some extra coin, in the king’s grand arena~~
~~as champions of quarreling nobles, or in the employ~~
~~of local merchants in need of seemingly weaponless~~
~~guards, pugilists can be found in all rungs of society.~~
~~Pugilists take pleasure in a battle hard won and thrill~~
~~in the energy of the fight rather than in a kill. They~~
~~can often be found celebrating or having drinks with~~
~~a former opponent hours after the fight, regardless of~~
~~the bout’s winner.~~
#### **Radiant Pikeman**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
You were a member of an order of knights dedicated to a deity of sun and light. You know that next to your deity’s favor, a soldier’s greatest strength is their comrades. You wield a spear, glaive, halberd, or other polearm as a piercing ray of sunlight against your enemies.
#### **Timeblade**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
There are warriors who move so quickly that they seem to stop time, then there are those who actually alter time with their attacks. The timeblade augments physical attacks by manipulating temporal powers and eventually learns to step outside time itself.
#### **Tunnel Watcher**<sup>(TOH)</sup>
For untold ages, the dwarves have paid in blood to keep their subterranean homes safe. The keystone to the defense of the dwarven citadels are the tunnel watchers, warriors trained in the tight, uneven paths beneath the surface of the world. While the techniques of the tunnel watchers originated with the dwarves, others see the value in such specialization. Tunnel watchers can thus be found throughout the mountainous regions of the world.
#### **Bodyguard**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
Bodyguards are highly skilled fighters that hone their skills and reflexes to recognize and react to threats swiftly, warn others of danger, and if necessary, put themselves in harms way to protect their charges. 

Anyone with the unflinching devotion to protect their allies can excel as a bodyguard. In the Forgotten Realms, the Masked Lords of Waterdeep often secure the services of bodyguards, as do many wealthy merchants traveling up and down the Sword Coast. In Eberron, the most famed and respected bodyguards in the Five Nations belong to House Deneith’s Defenders Guild, followed closely by distinguished members of House Medani’s Warning Guild.
#### **Fencer**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
Fencers are highly skilled duelists and swordmasters. These quick-footed warriors forego the usual heavy armor that most fighters wear, in favor of unfettered movement and flexibility. Fencers have a flair for style and panache, and usually seize victory with a cunningly precise strike that leaves their foes baffled, and shortly thereafter, bleeding. 

Some fencers are rumored to be unsavory rakes and scoundrels, while many others are featured in songs and chronicles as heroes with a bold and audacious air. Some of these seedy rumors and heroic retellings might actually refer to the same person!
#### **Phoenix Knight**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
A Phoenix Knight has looked into myth and drawn inspiration from it. They have a burning passion for combat and protecting those closest to them. Through intense training and careful practice, they have learned how to channel this inner fire into something tangible. 

These fighters know how to harness their fire in order to retaliate against foes and heal friends. As their mastery grows, they can cauterize wounds with their flames and even emit powerful waves of heat. 

Those who mimic a phoenix have a fondness for flame and warmth. They relish sunlight and bonfires. They sometimes find themselves staring into fire, imagining enemies igniting and the wounds of allies cauterizing within the popping embers and dancing flames. Sometimes, if they stare hard enough, they can almost see feathers amid the ashes.
#### **Scrapper**<sup>(TCEE)</sup>
Some fighters hone their combat skills through sheer discipline and endless hours of training. They study tactics and techniques developed by time-honored experts in the art of war, and aspire to join their ranks. You are not one of those fighters. Scrappers learn to defend themselves on the street and in the tavern, fighting dirty and grabbing whatever’s at hand for a weapon. They’re probably grinning the whole time, too, except for when they’re spitting out teeth.
#### **Scofflaw**<sup>(HWD)</sup>
A fighter who hits hard and fights dirty, the Scofflaw balks at the ideals of honor and tradition, doing what they need to survive. Rules are made to be broken, and the Scofflaw extends this logic to their fighting style. Using every trick at their disposal to gain the upper hand against their foes, the Scoff- law cows their enemy into submission, or overwhelms their defenses with a single cheap shot. 

Scofflaws eventually trust their notorious reputation to do much of the work for them, gaining the ability to cause foes to quake with a single threat. Scofflaws are a diverse bunch that run the gamut from graceful yet deadly knaves to bruiser thugs. What ties them together is their belief that there’s no such thing as a bad win.
#### **Court Guard**<sup>(FCG)</sup>
The Court Guard employs the supernatural gifts of their regal benefactors to protect their charges. Whether their benefactor is a court of fey, fiends, or celestials, the court guard uses the training received from other realms to mold their fighting style. The court guard draws the attention of foes on the battlefield and debilitates enemies using these supernatural gifts.
#### **Phylax**<sup>(ECHH)</sup>
In a land of larger than life heroes, whose exploits are praised in song in every mead hall across the land, one should never underestimate the disciplined line fighter. A phylax is among the best of line fighters whose experience has allowed them to become a master of tactics as well. Driven by discipline, duty, and a keen understanding, they know that their shield and the soldier next to them are what will turn the tide of a battle, not individual heroics.
#### **Myrmidon**<sup>(ECHH)</sup>
Who is the mightiest warrior? A fighter who is quick with a blade? A commander who can rally the troops and lead an army to victory? A pious knight? No, the warrior who wields not blade, wits, or magic but a hero’s soul will al- ways prevail. Relentlessly fighting for glory, capable of perfectly adapting to any situation, always pushing onwards, a myrmidon decides their own fate. Others can squabble over the reasons why they failed, comparing training and styles, blaming each other as well as themselves, while the myrmidon never loses sight of the real prize: living on forever through deeds that echo through eternity.
#### **Weaponforger**<sup>(CCS)</sup>
Fighters of the Weaponforger Archetype are specially trained in modifying weapons to unlock their full potential. Their attacks are furious, yet calculated, and are enhanced with a variety of powerful arcane bursts. Often soldiers on the front line, these versatile warriors keep an arsenal of different weapons, ready for anything they might face.
#### **Tech Knight**<sup>(KT)</sup>
A Tech Knight believes that it is neither brains nor brawn that determine the best fighter, but the combination thereof. Why limit yourself to what nature has provided you when you can supplement your combat superiority in unique and inventive ways that give you the edge? You build and innovate on the cutting edge... and use that edge to hew through your foes. There are few things more dangerous than weaponized creativity in the hands of someone that knows how to use it. 

A Tech Knight could be called an inventor that opened the door of innovation, found the deadliest thing they could invent, and closed it once more, but that wouldn’t be accurate. They innovate continuously, improving their art, just with a highly specialized focus. Some perhaps adventure and fight to test their weapons, others perhaps turned to innovation to overcome some obstacle or seek to change the world, and others still care little for the science and engineering of the weapon, and merely cobbled together something to annihilate their foes.
#### **Adventurer**<sup>(KT)</sup>
An adventurer is a well rounded fighter that specializes in preparation. They are resourceful survivors that excel at tackling a wide range of situations with preparation. They are generalists who are always useful to have around. They come from any walk of life, sharing only a spirit of adventure and knack for being useful.
#### **Brawler**<sup>(KT)</sup>
A brawler is a fighter that takes a holistic approach to beating things down. They are not the specialized martial artists of monks, but can throw a punch... or a chair. They specialize in being resourceful and, more importantly, strong. Ranging from brutish thugs and drunks to witty chaps who had to learn to wag their fists as fast as their tongue to keep their head on their shoulders. 

A brawler is always armed and dangerous, and isn’t above using a weapon if it’s the handiest way to bash something; they just don’t view themselves as limited to traditional options.
#### **Champion Revised**<sup>(KT)</sup>
Champions strive for perfection—exemplars of form and fitness, they represent masters of straightforward martial prowess.
#### **Crusader**<sup>(KT)</sup>
Crusaders are fighters that serve a faith, often zealously so. They may be directly in the service of god, belong to an order of some kind, or have taken up a more personal cause. They wield powers that let them protect themselves from the evils of their foes and purge that which defies them. Some see them as similar to Paladins, but mistaking them for one can be a fatal mistake, as Crusaders are not restrained by an oath: enacting the will of the higher power they serve without such fetters.
#### **Spiritsworn**<sup>(KT)</sup>
A Spiritsworn fighter is one that masters their martial prowess in tandem with a special spirit weapon, forming an unbreakable bond of shared growth and becoming a peerless martial team.
#### **Green Knight**<sup>(KT)</sup>
The Green Knight is a fighter who draws on the power of nature to imbue their attacks with the strength of the earth itself. They are fierce defenders of the natural world, sworn to protect it at all costs.
#### **Runeguard**<sup>(XLNEE)</sup>
The runeguard seeks the magical power within ancient languages, and to hasten the speed of their blade and strengthen of their armor by imbuing them with the power of these runes.

#### **Bestiarius**<sup>(BoE)</sup>
Bestiarii are gladiators that specialize in fighting the fiercest beasts the arena has to offer. With a flair for the dramatic and instincts honed against apex predators, Bestiarii ensure not only a victorious fight, but an entertaining one. A Bestiarius might fight for glory, honor, or even the freedom of the very beasts they once opposed.
#### **Timeless Monumental**<sup>(CFSA)</sup>

#### **Discordant**<sup>(CFSA)</sup>

#### **Tavern Brawler**<sup>(LAL)</sup>
The taste of ale-soaked floorboards is a familiar flavor to Tavern Brawlers. Whether they’ve been thrown to the ground in a glorious takedown, blocked an improvised weapon with their teeth, or tackled a foe into a pile of flailing limbs, Tavern Brawlers cherish the memory of every scuffle that hasn’t been knocked out of their brains. 
Though most inns and pubs decry barroom brawls as unnecessarily damaging and expensive affairs, celebrated carpenter and philosopher Lottaw Ood proposed that without the constant kerfuffles, woodworkers and the entire lumber industry might collapse. In fact, more shrewd carpentry guilds have opened “Brawl-Inns”; taverns with dedicated brawling areas and a microtransaction economy that encourages fighters to purchase chairs with which to clout their fellow patrons.
#### **Couatl Herald**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
The Couatl Heralds were, or are, martial warriors whose intention was to neutralize threats without always resorting to deadly force. These combatants were a beloved symbol of peace in the once great city of Hearth, whose terrible destruction has been all but entirely lost to history. Perhaps you come from a long line of sequestered heralds who had escaped the city before its collapse, or maybe you found the age-old journals of one of the city’s training officers. Regard- less of how you come across this knowledge, training, and virtue, a true Couatl Herald defends the lives of all: regard- less of their transgressions.
#### **Steel Hawk**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
Powerful, nimble soldiers from the mountain city of Heavensteppe, Steel Hawks use explosive bursts of speed to launch themselves great distances in order to reach faraway threats. Despite their often heavy armor, those who follow this archetype leap and strike with the agility of seasoned assassins, becoming every inch the fearsome birds of prey their name would suggest.
#### **Meteor Knight**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
Meteor knights can exercise a limited degree of control over the gravity around them. These fighters command a growing collection of missiles and other debris that float around them, using it to mercilessly pelt targets beyond their reach or launch veritable hailstorms of meteorites. While a meteor knight’s abilities are magical in nature, such powers are often manifested from a connection to the astral sea rather than from arcane study. Knights of the highest order, or those who fill the role of leader in their community, may sometimes be referred to as Lode Stars.
#### **Shadow Knight**<sup>(TGS)</sup>
Fighters touched by the plane of shadow itself reign supreme in the dark. These warriors, called Shadow Knights, cloak themselves in darkness to become elusive phantoms on the battlefield. With each strike, they unleash the dark and chilling powers of the realm of shadow, sowing fear and uncertainty in the hearts of their enemies. While evil often thrives in darkness, Shadow Knights have no singular motivation, and simply use the powers of darkness as they would a sword or shield.
#### **Sea Captain**<sup>E</sup>

#### **Armiger**<sup>UAH</sup>
Armigers take pride in their armor and learn to use it to deflect attacks that might otherwise prove lethal. Masters of defense, these fighters create, mend, and maintain their own shields and suits of armor. Where many warriors enter battle hoping to make quick work of their enemies, Armigers focus on outlasting their foes rather than quickly dispatching them.
#### **Combat Medic**<sup>UAH</sup>
A Combat Medic knows how to create carnage as well as any other fighter, but also learns to deal with the aftermath. These fighters know how to quickly assess a situation to determine where they are most needed, and how to use materials on hand for feats of medical skill that save lives.
#### **Crusader**<sup>UAH</sup>
Archetypal Crusaders faithfully execute the will and enforce the ideologies of their deities, their martial prowess augmented by divine magic. Crusaders specialize in abjuration and evocation magic to better protect the allies of their god and destroy their god’s enemies. A crusader’s greatest ambition is to build an army of faithful devotees and bring the word of their deity to all.
#### **Gladiator**<sup>UAH</sup>
You’ve turned life or death combat into a form of entertainment. While other fighters focus on honing their skills to get the job done, gladiators combine martial prowess with crowd-pleasing. The only thing you love more than a good fight is a big audience cheering you on. You’ve learned to challenge your opponents to one-on-one combat and leverage your natural showmanship for advantage in combat.
#### **Gunslinger**<sup>UAH</sup>
You are one of a rare new breed of fighters in the world. Gunslingers master the use of firearms as they wrestle with their place in society, wander the world, and settle personal grudges. These fighters use new technology to do battle, but the reasons they fight are timeless. Gunslingers live by a code, though whether that code gives them free reign to terrorize the local town or demands they protect it at all costs depends on the path they choose for themselves. When you live and die by the gun, you’re a gunslinger.
#### **Seafarer**<sup>UAH</sup>
The seafarer has gone by many a name, depending
on the nature of their time upon the sea. Mariner,
bluejacket, sea dog — all of these hearty sailors are tied
together by a life on the waters and the trials it puts one
through. The seafarer is not always the most practiced
fighter, but what they lack in expertise they make up
for in camaraderie. A sailor knows how to bond with
their fellow crew to finish a task, and their shanty songs
keep morale high through even the roughest battle.
#### **The Spirit Fused**<sup>(OTG)</sup>
Those who take on the moniker of a spirit-fused fighter do not normally do so by choice but rather by circum- stance. Because to become a spirit-fused fighter, you must first become the vessel of a dying spirit, a task that can’t be accomplished by choice, as no one truly understands how or why this occurs. 

All that is known is that the spirit's mind and body have passed on, and its essence now coexists within the fighter, granting them abilities beyond the capability of a normal spirit. Those who can harness this power can channel the latent energy into objects, which produce a magical quirk or powerful attacks. These arcane tricks are how these unconventional warriors fight and are the reason they have garnered so much attention and interest on the island.
#### **Commander**<sup>(GTD)</sup>
Between the nations of Westemär, Elyria, and Caspia there have been countless wars fought. Many great knights, valiant soldiers, and powerful combatants have tested their mettle against man and monster alike. Amongst the brave there are always those who are born to lead, and the Commander is just that. They stand at the front of battle, uniting their allies and leading the charge against their enemies.

*Risk is in a gunslinger's blood. They are bold renegades, bucking tradition and forging a new path with dangerous and inelegant firearms. Gunslingers are infamous for surviving by their wits, relying on split-second timing and a considerable amount of luck to survive. (**Source: Valda’s Spire of Secrets**)*

*Black powder is not for the faint of heart. Its thunderous applause is volatile and imprecise—a barely controlled explosion directed at an enemy. Only the truly fearless seek to master it, for one must be mad or have nerves of steel to weather the risk of its use. But those who call themselves gunslingers are fearless combatants, hurling death from their guns in a roaring cacophony. Adapted for shootouts, gunslingers are mobile and daring, knowing that life or death hangs on snap decision-making and one's own mettle.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Gunslinger’s Creeds</u>

*Gunslingers have many features in common, but each of them walks their own path and follows thewir own code. This code, which gunslingers call a creed, embodies their core beliefs and informs their unique combat style.*

### *Valda’s Spire of Secrets*
#### **Gun Tank Creed**
Be bigger, be badder, and be tougher, and no man will stand in your way. You are a living siege engine, a titan of muscle, brandishing weapons most men are incapable of lifting. Armed with these devastating firearms, you wade into the field of battle, bombarding and destroying those foolish enough to approach you.
#### **Gun-Ko Master Creed**
The ancient art of gun-ko is passed through generations of gunslingers who study the gun as a perfect weapon and meditate on its intricacies. This path is not for the impatient or the faint of heart, but those who practice it diligently make their guns an extension of themselves, learning to strike with the speed of a rifle and catch bullets out of the air.
#### **High Roller Creed**
Fortune is a fickle thing—unless you're a high roller. These gunslingers are master card sharps and dice throwers that mix their love of risk with their talent for gunplay. High rollers push their luck until it runs out, then push harder. Why settle for just a win when you could bet it all and win big?
#### **Musketeer Creed**
You believe that camaraderie and glory go hand-in-hand, that you and your allies are undefeatable as long as you stand together. As such, you have trained with blades and halberds, so that you battle up close and personal. Your place is not supporting them from afar, but launching a single volley of shot before charging in, bayonet or cutlass in hand, that you might all succeed or fail as one. 
#### **Pistolero Creed**
Bullets are power, and you have long believed that more bullets equal more power. Your expertise is in delivering a hail of deadly fire to pulverize your enemies. Not every bullet needs to be accurate to make a difference.
#### **Sharpshooter Creed**
A well-placed bullet is more powerful than a sword, arrow, or spell. Indeed, you believe that every violent conflict should sound like a single loud crack followed by a long silence. Such shots need to be delivered perfectly, even at range, for when they are done right, they are as deadly for the target as they are stupendous for the audience.
#### **Spellslinger Creed**
Magic and guns aren't so different. If arcane power is like gunpowder and a spell is like a bullet, you are like a gun, directing your spells with precision at unfortunate targets. You mix the disciplines of gun and spell, sometimes loading arcane charges with your shots and firing streaks of lighting, frost, or flame in the wake of your bullet.
#### **Trick Shot Creed**
Accuracy means different things to different people. For you, true accuracy isn't necessarily in hitting a target on the first shot, but might include hitting the mark after the bullet bounces around a dozen times. Your attacks are just as dangerous if they miss, or even after hitting their mark, as others' are while they're still in the air.
#### **White Hat Creed**
Some gunslingers live by a code and expect others to do the same. These gunslingers, known as white hats, sometimes serve as agents of local or regional law but never hesitate to do what's right no matter what the rules say. Despite their affinity for deadly weapons, white hats prefer to keep their friends safe and take their enemies in unharmed—a preference they find their enemies aren't often inclined to oblige.
## ~~Herald~~
~~*Often feared or misunderstood, driven by an unending drive to destroy the wicked, blood hunters are clever, arcane warriors who have bound their essence to the dark creatures they hunt. Armed with the rites of forbidden blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for the cause, they protect the realms from the shadows, ever vigilant to avoid becoming the same monsters they vow to hunt.*~~

~~*Through careful study and practice, blood hunters have honed the rites of hemocraft into their combat prowess, forfeiting a facet of their health to infuse their weapons with powerful blood magic and summoning the elements to envelop their strikes. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force against the terrors that threaten the innocent.*~~ 

### ~~<u>Subclasses - Blood Hunter Orders</u>~~

~~*There are a handful of secretive orders of blood hunters that guard their cryptic techniques and rituals. One must adhere to one of these orders to even be granted access to the Hunter’s Bane rite that starts their journey, and only once they’ve proven their dedication and ability will the secrets of the order begin to be revealed. It’s within these small, enigmatic sects that the real power of a blood hunter is learned.*~~
### ~~*Level Up: Advanced 5e*~~
~~Green Knight~~
~~Holy Champion~~
~~Inquisitor~~
## Investigator
*There are forces more ancient than time, foes more sinister than the foulest men, and beings more titanic than gods. The world stands at a precipice of woe and terror, being threatened nightly by dark agents and hordes of monsters. At risk to their own lives and sanities, investigators penetrate the evil that creeps in the shadows and banish it from the world. Their battles are never-ending, for victory only delays doomsday another night. (**Source: Valda’s Spire of Secrets**)*

*Investigators track supernatural threats ranging from incorporeal spirits, to nefarious vampires and lycanthropes, to incursions of demons and devils. Often in their investigations, they often uncover secret cults and maligned individuals who bring these supernatural threats to bear. It is always their goal to impede these evildoers by any means necessary, resorting to trickery, guile, magic, and bloodshed when necessary. To an investigator, no tactic is unthinkable when the world is at stake.*

*Even as they strive to contain its influence from the world at large, investigators dabble in forbidden magic to give themselves an edge against supernatural threats. Prepared investigators keep a well-stocked grimoire of magical secrets, containing rituals, incantations, notes on monsters' powers and weaknesses, recipes for poisons, and arcane diagrams—everything needed to confront their foes on an even footing. Even so, an investigator's occupation is perilous. A grimoire might spell out a vampire's fear of sunlight and aversion to silver, but it does little to hinder their fangs.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Occult Specializations</u>

*Investigators of all stripes share thee broad goal of combating the occult, but their methods vary wildly. Some emphasize cutting down monsters and banishing demons, while others believe that uncovering secrets and compiling critical information is the surest method for eliminating supernatural threats. When an investigator gains enough experience, they can steer their approach, including their specific techniques they employ, and the trinkets they carry, into an occult specialization — a school of thought for handling eldritch threats.*

#### **Antiquarian Specialization**
Festooned with magical trinkets from every corner of the globe, antiquarians have a tool for every occasion: silver arrowheads for lycanthropes, heartwood stakes for vampires, blessed relics for fiends, and so on. As they expand their collections from piles of trinkets to veritable museums, they become adept historians and arcanists, familiar with the story of every magic item their care, as well how to use them in dire situations.
#### **Archivist Specialization**
Though most investigators fill their grimoires with hard-won knowledge borne from encounters with the supernatural threats, some prefer to do bookkeeping instead. Such archivists accrue knowledge, not trinkets, by spending untold hours digging through disparate tomes of occult knowledge and compiling them into encyclopedic texts on the supernatural. Through their research, archivists become academic masters of the arcane, and priceless reservoirs of obscure knowledge.
#### **Detective Specialization**
Prowling at the edge of darkness, detectives chase down clues and pull on threads to unravel conspiracies which bring darkness into the world. Sometimes, this requires that you infiltrate a cult's secret meetings, other times it calls on you to reconstruct a man's last moments at a murder scene, but no matter what the mystery, you know that there is always an explanation.
#### **Exterminator Specialization**
An exterminator suffers no monster to live. Trained in the art of slaying aberrations, fiends, and undead, you stand against evil where others falter, and draw your blade before others recognize a threat. Grand schemes and plots are less important than retribution against those monsters which stalk the night, and your thirst for such retribution is unquenchable. There is always another werewolf to be slain, another vampire to be staked, another demon to be banished; people rarely thank you, but you find satisfaction enough in your work.
#### **Inquisitor Specialization**
The church has long been the first line of defense against the tide of impending darkness. Yet, the clergy's stubborn devotion to righteousness impedes them where it counts: you must sometimes be willing to do evil to counter evil. That's where the inquisition comes in.

As a righteous inquisitor of the faith, you are tasked with rooting out heresy, exorcising demons, and stamping out any sign of the occult, and are offered clemency for any action you take in the defense of the greater good. You may investigate anyone or anything you deem to be in line with the forces of evil, for you alone are a holy blade in the dark, the arbiter of your church.
#### **Medium Specialization**
As conduits between the living and dead, mediums offer an essential glimpse past the veil of mortality. Using their auguries, seances, and divinations, mediums can retrieve morsels of information from the afterlife to settle debts with the living or and assist ongoing investigations. This information, however cryptic, can point an interested party toward clues or evidence which only the deceased might be able to provide.
#### **Occultist Specialization**
Vampires, demons, lycanthropes, and aberrations all have one thing in common: they are all magical threats, best combated through magical means. To meet these foes on a level playing field, occultists indulge in arcana, filling their grimoires with magical secrets and mastering a handful of spells. Occultists are the most likely investigators to cavort with warlocks, borrow tricks from wizards and magicians, and dabble in dark magic to defeat their foes.
#### **Spy Specialization**
Infiltration, disguise, and lying through their teeth: these are the principle skills of a spy. A talented spy rarely ever needs to draw a dagger to silence someone, for their honeyed words and agreeable disposition are all that is needed to draw out someone's secrets. Of course, when they do strike, it is decisively and without warning. Such skills are invaluable for governments and organizations of all varieties, for stealing confidential information, sabotage, monitoring persons of interest, and everything in between.
## Justiciar
*Justiciars are a unique mix of soldier and lawyer. They serve the Arcane Court, an independent, nation-neutral magical law agency whose jurisdiction is spellcasters and magical beings. These arcane law officers spend years in study and training to reach peak physical, mental, and magical conditioning, and it shows when you run afoul of them.(**Source: DM’s Guild**)*

*Every justiciar is an officer of the Arcane Court, but begins life in the organization as a mere student, learning all manner of minutiae in not only magical law, but the strengths and weaknesses of all manner of magical creatures she can expect to encounter in the outer world. After passing extensive tests on these materials, the student advances to martial training, applying her knowledge of all manner of creatures to practical applications of how to subdue and slay them, and learning in what situations it is appropriate to do either. Only after completing long years of both these trainings is a student adopted into the Arcane Court as an apprentice, a role in which she is allowed to journey into the wide world as a representative of the Court, and begin practicing a justiciar’s unique style of arcane pursuits.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Court Divisions</u>

*The Arcane Court acts as an independent law-enforcement, court, and correctional system for magic users and magical entities. The organization’s general neutrality serves to make it a trusted body by most nations, despite it having no alliance or ties to anyone. The Court is broken into several divisions that each serve a purpose within its judiciary system, the members of which are each trained in martial combat and battle magic, in addition to the scripts of law, in case justice needs to be dispensed on the road. Most of the Court’s work involves sending individual justiciars to wander the planes and prevent otherwise unreported crimes. Certain matters, however, require that a creature be brought back to face trial in one of the Court’s headquarters. Such creatures are offered two choices of trial: judgment in court by a high-ranking justiciar who has been distinguished with the rank of Judge, or a trial by combat.*

#### **Defense Division**
This division’s primary responsibility is to represent accused creatures in trials presided over by a Judge. They can also be hired by expeditions to act as escorts and protectors.
#### **Enforcement Division**
This division’s primary responsibility is the tracking and subdual of wanted criminals, and the investigation of crime scenes. They can also be hired as private detectives to locate and retrieve missing persons and objects.
#### **Execution Division**
This division’s primary responsibility is to execute creatures found guilty by a Judge, creatures whom the Judge believes are incapable of reformation. Though a justiciar of any division can be called upon to take part in a trial by combat, members of this division are most likely to receive the order. They can also be hired to slay creatures that are plaguing settlements.
#### **Prosecution Division**
This division’s primary responsibility is the investigation and prosecution of accused creatures in trials presided over by a Judge. They can also be hired by local governments and groups to mediate disputes and explore unknown areas.
#### **Reformation Division**
This division’s primary responsibility is to oversee the correction of prisoners a Judge has determined can be reformed. They most often do so by magically linking with the creature and showing them the correct behaviors by having the creature fight alongside them as an ally. They can also be hired to capture and transport problematic individuals.

## Martyr
*Martyrs are chosen by the gods, predestined to speed forth to a final destination: they are ordained to die for a great cause. They are prophets and oracles, great priests and liberators. Regardless of how much good they might accomplish in their lives, the end must always be the same: a glorious death, to be remembered in legend. No matter the circumstance, a martyr cannot avoid their destiny. While some martyrs gladly accept their holy approbation, others struggle against it. However, from the moment the gods choose their martyr, they shall intervene in the martyr's fate, pulling them inexorably towards their cause. The gods will settle for a lesser martyr if they must—if the one chosen is unwilling to follow their path—but they always prefer to uplift their martyr to the heights of sainthood before their inevitable death. (**Source: Valda’s Spire of Secrets**)*

*As martyrs are ordained by the gods to die, their suffering is holy sacrament. Martyrs brought close to death grow more powerful, not less, and those that spill their own blood evoke waves of divine energy. In the view of the gods, such hardship only heightens martyrdom and hastens the martyr to their destiny. Paradoxically, martyrs are protected from death's precipice even as they are edged closer towards it. Every torment and persecution suffered by them is weighed with equal moments of respite offered by the gods. The gods do not mean to kill their charge early; a martyr should meet their fate only at the preordained time and place.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Mortal Burdens</u>

*Martyrs are created and driven forth to right an inexorable wrong wrong in the world. On this quest, thjey are a diurect instrument of the gods, and no matter how hard they try, they cannot escape the burden of their duty. *

## Psion
*Often feared or misunderstood, driven by an unending drive to destroy the wicked, blood hunters are clever, arcane warriors who have bound their essence to the dark creatures they hunt. Armed with the rites of forbidden blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for the cause, they protect the realms from the shadows, ever vigilant to avoid becoming the same monsters they vow to hunt.*

*Through careful study and practice, blood hunters have honed the rites of hemocraft into their combat prowess, forfeiting a facet of their health to infuse their weapons with powerful blood magic and summoning the elements to envelop their strikes. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force against the terrors that threaten the innocent.* 

### <u>Subclasses - Psionic Awakenings</u>

*There are a handful of secretive orders of blood hunters that guard their cryptic techniques and rituals. One must adhere to one of these orders to even be granted access to the Hunter’s Bane rite that starts their journey, and only once they’ve proven their dedication and ability will the secrets of the order begin to be revealed. It’s within these small, enigmatic sects that the real power of a blood hunter is learned.*

## Warmage
*Often feared or misunderstood, driven by an unending drive to destroy the wicked, blood hunters are clever, arcane warriors who have bound their essence to the dark creatures they hunt. Armed with the rites of forbidden blood magic and a willingness to sacrifice their own vitality and humanity for the cause, they protect the realms from the shadows, ever vigilant to avoid becoming the same monsters they vow to hunt.*

*Through careful study and practice, blood hunters have honed the rites of hemocraft into their combat prowess, forfeiting a facet of their health to infuse their weapons with powerful blood magic and summoning the elements to envelop their strikes. Willing to suffer whatever it takes to achieve victory, these adept warriors have forged themselves into a potent force against the terrors that threaten the innocent.*

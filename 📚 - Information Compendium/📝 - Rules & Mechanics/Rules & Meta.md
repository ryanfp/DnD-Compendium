A short list on what meta or “out of world” apply to my games. 

---
### Introduction

- ##### ***Flow Comes First**. Let’s play a game where things get done. 
	- We’ll keep rule arguments to a minimum, relying on previous rulings or notes I’ve kept here when possible. 
	- If you have a hard time with focus, try keeping notes. If *I* have a hard time keeping *you* engaged, tell me. 
	- Know your character. Early game is fine to not know class/sub-class mechanics. Once we reach around 20-30 hours spent in a campaign, you should remember your features. Have an idea of what you want to do on your turn in combat. I do not use timers but will implement one if needed to keep things rolling. 

- ##### ***Immersion is King.** Let’s play a game where people are immersed. 
	- Respect the scene. Keep meta talk to a minimum. 
	- Respect the characters. Don’t joke when people are roleplaying. Especially do not joke *about* people’s roleplaying. 
	- Respect the ignorance. Artless exposition might be worse than focused ignorance. 
	- Respect the player. Players can ask for what they need, don’t volunteer it unprompted. 
	- Respect the game. You are not someone playing a character in a game, you *are* that character in the game. 

- ##### ***The Story is Collaborative.** Be mindful of others. 
	- We are all main characters in this experience. 
	- Everyone will get their time in the spotlight, don’t hog it. Eager participation is welcomed, eager participation *at the detriment of others* is not. 
	- Express your desires for the story and your character. It’s not guaranteed, but I can take the essence of a thought and implement it. 

- ##### ***It’s the Game Master, not the Game Suggester.** Respect, Don’t Dictate. 
	- Rulings will try to be fair and consistent. That said, no whining. 
	- Stop asking to level up. 
	- Boons or rulings *might* be player or situation-specific. Do not expect something, but appreciate it. 

- ##### ***NO METAGAMING**

### Meta

- **Less Tedious Action Cost**
	- No action cost for equipping, sheathing or drawing any weapon or gear. 
	- You can cast spells while holding shields, swords or anything. 
	- You can interact with full hands. 
	- Material components are *mostly* done away with. Special spells where the components are valuable/important retain these. Otherwise something *else* may be the cost. 
- **No Encumbrance**
	- Weight will not be tracked. You may be limited in what you can carry but I will not be counting the pounds of the items you do carry. 
- **How Do You Want to Do This?**
	- When you make the killing blow on a mini-boss or boss level enemy, you can embellish the scene. Have fun with it!
- **Rule of Cool**
	- Fun and creativity over rigid guardrails. Sometimes the unorthodox answer is the best. 
	- Don’t be afraid to give ideas, even if they’re outlandish or don’t seem “correct”. 
- **Critical Success and Critical Failures**
	- Rolling the max or min on a d20 causes the result to be extra exaggerated. 
	- In the case of a 20, it is the **best possible outcome.** In the case of a 1, it is the **worst possible outcome.** 
	- This does not mean you will magically convince the king to give up his kingdom and title because you rolled a 20, it means he will laugh it off as a hearty joke and not instantly execute your ass. 
	- Critical Failures during combat trigger a roll on the [[Critical Fumble]] table depending on the weapon used. 
- **Custom Ability Point Buy**
	- When making a character you will use a slightly edited [point buy system](https://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html#select&NA&8&8&8&8&8&8&0&0&27&15&8&19&15&12&9&7&5&4&3&2&1&0&1&2&4&6&9&4&4&4&4&4&4). 
	- Most values are the same, you get a maximum of **30** points to spend instead of 27. Minimum and maximum values of abilities remain the same. 
- **Feats & Flavorful Feats**
	- Feats are now earned every three (3) **character** levels, not subclass levels. 
	- There are no half, full or ASIs. You get a feat which comes with a +1 to a stat of your choice.
	- Some feats have been moved to be specific to character creation or [[downtime activities]].
		- These are called [[Flavorful Feats]] and they have been modified from their original form to no longer include ASI (if applicable).
- **Flanking**
	- Flanking is not used, it is an optional rule from the DMG. 
- **Advantage & Disadvantage Stacking**
	- Normally, each additional instance of advantage or disadvantage does nothing. Now each additional instance will grant a flat +1/-1 to the rolls you make per instance.
	- Furthermore, each opposite instance will cancel out only one instance. For example, you have 2 instances of advantage, granting you Advantage + 1 to the roll. You are now affected by disadvantage, and the roll is simply done with Advantage. 
- **Hidden (Death Saves)**
	- When a player reaches 0 HP, they become unconscious and are considered “downed”. On the start of their turn they must roll a death saving throw. A 10 or higher is a success and a 9 or below is a failure. 3 successes [[stabilizes]] the player, whereas at 3 failures, the player dies. 
	- A 20 lowers the DC for subsequent rolls by 2 (to an 8 or higher), and a 1 raises the DC by 2 (to a 12 or higher).
	- The player must roll the death saves *in secret* with the DM. ~~A successful DC 10 medicine check on the player (Must be within 5 feet, action cost is a bonus action) reveals their current save count.~~
	- Normal enemies will not target players after they have been downed. This feels unfair and can be especially crushing with multi-attacks. Reasonably it can be assumed that in a fight a creature won’t target something that poses no threat and will instead target those that do. 
	- Inversely, creatures with an intelligence stat *below* 4 can and will target downed creatures if they were their aggressor (i.e. a bear downs a player and will continue mauling said player on subsequent turns unless it is deterred or distracted). Special cases of intelligent creatures targeting downed ones may be: bounty hunters, assassins, adversaries with particularly deep grudges, etc. 
- **HP Choice on Level Up**
	- When you level up and are rolling your hit die for HP, you may take the average if you roll lower. 
- **Boss Enemy HP + Visibility**
	- Bosses and Mini-Bosses will have their HP formulas maxed. 
	- Mini-Bosses reveal their health bar at half health and bosses will never reveal. 
- **More “Critical” Criticals / Maxed Criticals**
	- Rolling a critical on an attack roll gives you a max roll on your damage die. (i.e. 1d8 damage die on a critical would be 1d8+8).
- **Inspiration**
	- Instead of inspiration granting advantage on any d20 roll, it grants a bonus die. 
	- The bonus die is a d6 that increases as the character grows in level. From levels 1-4 it’s a d6, from levels 5-9 it’s a d8, levels 10-14 a d10 and finally 15+ it is a d12. 
	- More than one inspiration cannot be used on the same roll. 
	- You cannot use inspiration on a roll the same *round* you received it. 
	- Players can give their inspiration to one another, but must describe how they are doing so. 
- **Absolute Critical Rolls**
	- Rolling a 1 or 20 on a d20 is unchangeable short of divine intervention or a wish spell or an unexplained important mechanic in any campaign.
	- Furthermore, any 1 or 20 auto-fails or auto-succeeds, respectively. This applies to skill checks, saving throws, or attack rolls. 
- **Pocket Criticals**
	- In the event you roll with advantage and get two natural 20s, you may pocket one of them for later use to replace any d20 roll you make(provided it was not a Nat 1).
	- However, if you happen to be so incredibly unlucky that you roll two natural 1s, *the DM* may pocket one of them for later use *on that characters* future rolls (provided it is not a Nat 20). 
- **Countermagic Surge**
	- When someone counterspells a counterspell, both must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table. 
- **Resurrection Rituals**
	- Instead of spells like Revivify or Raise Dead, a resurrection ritual is performed. 
	`When a creature is targeted by a resurrection spell with a casting time longer than one action, such as Raise Dead or Resurrection, a ritual is initiated in which up to three creatures can contribute in order to call the creature's soul back to their body. The creature makes an ability check with a skill the DM deems appropriate for the action, against a DC that the DM also determines.
	
	`For each successful check, the creature's death DC is lowered by 3 for this ritual. For each failure, it increases by 1 for this ritual. The DM makes the final roll against this DC. On a success, the creature is returned to life if its soul is willing. On a failure, the creature's soul is lost, and further resurrection rituals fail automatically.
	
	`Only the strongest of magic can bypass this ritual, in the form the True Resurrection or Wish spells. These spells can also return to life a creature whose soul was lost from a failed ritual.``mind body soul roll 3 d20s averaghe them
- **Exhaustion**
	- We will use a slightly altered version of the 2024e version of exhaustion mechanics

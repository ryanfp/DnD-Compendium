The 2024e of D&D changed the mechanics of exhaustion in the new Players Handbook. I have altered this further to be a little more punishing/balanced. The table below is the new rules:

| Exhaustion Mechanics |     <     |    <     |    <   |    <   |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|
|         Level        | D20 Rolls | Spell DC |  Speed | HP Max |
|           1          |     -2    |    -2    |  -5 ft |   -5%  |
|           2          |     -4    |    -4    | -10 ft |  -10%  |
|           3          |     -6    |    -6    | -15 ft |  -15%  |
|           4          |     -8    |    -8    | -20 ft |  -20%  |
|           5          |    -10    |   -10    | -25 ft |  -25%  |
|           6          |   Death   |  Death   | Death  |  Death |
